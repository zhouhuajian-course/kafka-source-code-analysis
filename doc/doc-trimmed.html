            Event streaming is the digital equivalent of the human body's central nervous system. It is the
            technological foundation for the 'always-on' world where businesses are increasingly software-defined
            and automated, and where the user of software is more software.

            Technically speaking, event streaming is the practice of capturing data in real-time from event sources
            like databases, sensors, mobile devices, cloud services, and software applications in the form of streams
            of events; storing these event streams durably for later retrieval; manipulating, processing, and reacting
            to the event streams in real-time as well as retrospectively; and routing the event streams to different
            destination technologies as needed. Event streaming thus ensures a continuous flow and interpretation of
            data so that the right information is at the right place, at the right time.

            <a href="#intro_nutshell">How does Kafka work in a nutshell?</a>
        </h4>
        <p>
            Kafka is a distributed system consisting of <strong>servers</strong> and <strong>clients</strong> that
            communicate via a high-performance <a href="/protocol.html">TCP network protocol</a>.
            It can be deployed on bare-metal hardware, virtual machines, and containers in on-premise as well as cloud
            environments.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Servers</strong>: Kafka is run as a cluster of one or more servers that can span multiple datacenters
            or cloud regions. Some of these servers form the storage layer, called the brokers. Other servers run
            <a href="/documentation/#connect">Kafka Connect</a> to continuously import and export
            data as event streams to integrate Kafka with your existing systems such as relational databases as well as
            other Kafka clusters. To let you implement mission-critical use cases, a Kafka cluster is highly scalable
            and fault-tolerant: if any of its servers fails, the other servers will take over their work to ensure
            continuous operations without any data loss.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Clients</strong>: They allow you to write distributed applications and microservices that read, write,
            and process streams of events in parallel, at scale, and in a fault-tolerant manner even in the case of network
            problems or machine failures. Kafka ships with some such clients included, which are augmented by
            <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Clients">dozens of clients</a> provided by the Kafka
            community: clients are available for Java and Scala including the higher-level
            <a href="/documentation/streams/">Kafka Streams</a> library, for Go, Python, C/C++, and
            many other programming languages as well as REST APIs.

        </h4>
        <p>
            An <strong>event</strong> records the fact that "something happened" in the world or in your business. It is also called record or message in the documentation. When you read or write data to Kafka, you do this in the form of events. Conceptually, an event has a key, value, timestamp, and optional metadata headers. Here's an example event:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Event key: "Alice"
            </li>
            <li>
                Event value: "Made a payment of $200 to Bob"
            </li>
            <li>
                Event timestamp: "Jun. 25, 2020 at 2:06 p.m."
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Producers</strong> are those client applications that publish (write) events to Kafka, and <strong>consumers</strong> are those that subscribe to (read and process) these events. In Kafka, producers and consumers are fully decoupled and agnostic of each other, which is a key design element to achieve the high scalability that Kafka is known for. For example, producers never need to wait for consumers. Kafka provides various <a href="/documentation/#semantics">guarantees</a> such as the ability to process events exactly-once.
        </p>
        <p>
            Events are organized and durably stored in <strong>topics</strong>. Very simplified, a topic is similar to a folder in a filesystem, and the events are the files in that folder. An example topic name could be "payments". Topics in Kafka are always multi-producer and multi-subscriber: a topic can have zero, one, or many producers that write events to it, as well as zero, one, or many consumers that subscribe to these events. Events in a topic can be read as often as needed—unlike traditional messaging systems, events are not deleted after consumption. Instead, you define for how long Kafka should retain your events through a per-topic configuration setting, after which old events will be discarded. Kafka's performance is effectively constant with respect to data size, so storing data for a long time is perfectly fine.
        </p>
        <p>
            Topics are <strong>partitioned</strong>, meaning a topic is spread over a number of "buckets" located on different Kafka brokers. This distributed placement of your data is very important for scalability because it allows client applications to both read and write the data from/to many brokers at the same time. When a new event is published to a topic, it is actually appended to one of the topic's partitions. Events with the same event key (e.g., a customer or vehicle ID) are written to the same partition, and Kafka <a href="/documentation/#semantics">guarantees</a> that any consumer of a given topic-partition will always read that partition's events in exactly the same order as they were written.
        </p>
        <figure class="figure">
            <p>.......</p>
            <figcaption class="figure-caption">
                Figure: This example topic has four partitions P1–P4. Two different producer clients are publishing,
                independently from each other, new events to the topic by writing events over the network to the topic's
                partitions. Events with the same key (denoted by their color in the figure) are written to the same
                partition. Note that both producers can write to the same partition if appropriate.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            To make your data fault-tolerant and highly-available, every topic can be <strong>replicated</strong>, even across geo-regions or datacenters, so that there are always multiple brokers that have a copy of the data just in case things go wrong, you want to do maintenance on the brokers, and so on. A common production setting is a replication factor of 3, i.e., there will always be three copies of your data. This replication is performed at the level of topic-partitions.

            </li>
            <li>
                The <a href="/documentation/streams">Kafka Streams API</a> to implement stream processing applications and microservices. It provides higher-level functions to process event streams, including transformations, stateful operations like aggregations and joins, windowing, processing based on event-time, and more. Input is read from one or more topics in order to generate output to one or more topics, effectively transforming the input streams to output streams.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <a href="/documentation.html#connect">Kafka Connect API</a> to build and run reusable data import/export connectors that consume (read) or produce (write) streams of events from and to external systems and applications so they can integrate with Kafka. For example, a connector to a relational database like PostgreSQL might capture every change to a set of tables. However, in practice, you typically don't need to implement your own connectors because the Kafka community already provides hundreds of ready-to-use connectors.

    <h3 class="anchor-heading"><a id="uses" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#uses">1.2 Use Cases</a></h3>


    <p> Here is a description of a few of the popular use cases for Apache Kafka®.
        For an overview of a number of these areas in action, see <a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying/">this blog post</a>. </p>

    <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="uses_messaging" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#uses_messaging">Messaging</a></h4>

    Kafka works well as a replacement for a more traditional message broker.
    Message brokers are used for a variety of reasons (to decouple processing from data producers, to buffer unprocessed messages, etc).
    In comparison to most messaging systems Kafka has better throughput, built-in partitioning, replication, and fault-tolerance which makes it a good
    solution for large scale message processing applications.
    <p>
        In our experience messaging uses are often comparatively low-throughput, but may require low end-to-end latency and often depend on the strong
        durability guarantees Kafka provides.
    </p><p>
    In this domain Kafka is comparable to traditional messaging systems such as <a href="http://activemq.apache.org">ActiveMQ</a> or
    <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com">RabbitMQ</a>.

</p><h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="uses_website" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#uses_website">Website Activity Tracking</a></h4>

    The original use case for Kafka was to be able to rebuild a user activity tracking pipeline as a set of real-time publish-subscribe feeds.
    This means site activity (page views, searches, or other actions users may take) is published to central topics with one topic per activity type.
    These feeds are available for subscription for a range of use cases including real-time processing, real-time monitoring, and loading into Hadoop or
    offline data warehousing systems for offline processing and reporting.
    <p>
        Activity tracking is often very high volume as many activity messages are generated for each user page view.

    </p><h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="uses_metrics" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#uses_metrics">Metrics</a></h4>

    Kafka is often used for operational monitoring data.
    This involves aggregating statistics from distributed applications to produce centralized feeds of operational data.

    <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="uses_logs" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#uses_logs">Log Aggregation</a></h4>

    Many people use Kafka as a replacement for a log aggregation solution.
    Log aggregation typically collects physical log files off servers and puts them in a central place (a file server or HDFS perhaps) for processing.
    Kafka abstracts away the details of files and gives a cleaner abstraction of log or event data as a stream of messages.
    This allows for lower-latency processing and easier support for multiple data sources and distributed data consumption.

    In comparison to log-centric systems like Scribe or Flume, Kafka offers equally good performance, stronger durability guarantees due to replication,
    and much lower end-to-end latency.

    <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="uses_streamprocessing" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#uses_streamprocessing">Stream Processing</a></h4>

    Many users of Kafka process data in processing pipelines consisting of multiple stages, where raw input data is consumed from Kafka topics and then
    aggregated, enriched, or otherwise transformed into new topics for further consumption or follow-up processing.
    For example, a processing pipeline for recommending news articles might crawl article content from RSS feeds and publish it to an "articles" topic;
    further processing might normalize or deduplicate this content and publish the cleansed article content to a new topic;
    a final processing stage might attempt to recommend this content to users.
    Such processing pipelines create graphs of real-time data flows based on the individual topics.
    Starting in 0.10.0.0, a light-weight but powerful stream processing library called <a href="/documentation/streams">Kafka Streams</a>
    is available in Apache Kafka to perform such data processing as described above.
    Apart from Kafka Streams, alternative open source stream processing tools include <a href="https://storm.apache.org/">Apache Storm</a> and
    <a href="http://samza.apache.org/">Apache Samza</a>.

    <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="uses_eventsourcing" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#uses_eventsourcing">Event Sourcing</a></h4>

    <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html">Event sourcing</a> is a style of application design where state changes are logged as a
    time-ordered sequence of records. Kafka's support for very large stored log data makes it an excellent backend for an application built in this style.

    <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="uses_commitlog" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#uses_commitlog">Commit Log</a></h4>

    Kafka can serve as a kind of external commit-log for a distributed system. The log helps replicate data between nodes and acts as a re-syncing
    mechanism for failed nodes to restore their data.
    The <a href="/documentation.html#compaction">log compaction</a> feature in Kafka helps support this usage.
    In this usage Kafka is similar to <a href="https://bookkeeper.apache.org/">Apache BookKeeper</a> project.

                <a href="#quickstart_createtopic">Step 3: Create a topic to store your events</a>
            </h4>

            <p>
                Kafka is a distributed <em>event streaming platform</em> that lets you read, write, store, and process
                <a href="/documentation/#messages"><em>events</em></a> (also called <em>records</em> or
                <em>messages</em> in the documentation)
                across many machines.
            </p>

            <p>
                Example events are payment transactions, geolocation updates from mobile phones, shipping orders, sensor measurements
                from IoT devices or medical equipment, and much more. These events are organized and stored in
                <a href="/documentation/#intro_concepts_and_terms"><em>topics</em></a>.
                Very simplified, a topic is similar to a folder in a filesystem, and the events are the files in that folder.
            </p>

            <p>
                So before you can write your first events, you must create a topic.  Open another terminal session and run:
            </p>

            <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash">$ bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic quickstart-events --bootstrap-server localhost:9092<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>

            <p>
                All of Kafka's command line tools have additional options: run the <code>kafka-topics.sh</code> command without any
                arguments to display usage information. For example, it can also show you
                <a href="/documentation/#intro_concepts_and_terms">details such as the partition count</a>
                of the new topic:
            </p>

            </h4>

            <p>
                A Kafka client communicates with the Kafka brokers via the network for writing (or reading) events.
                Once received, the brokers will store the events in a durable and fault-tolerant manner for as long as you
                need—even forever.
            </p>

            <p>
                Run the console producer client to write a few events into your topic.
                By default, each line you enter will result in a separate event being written to the topic.
            </p>

            <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash">$ bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --topic quickstart-events --bootstrap-server localhost:9092

            <p>
                You can stop the producer client with <code>Ctrl-C</code> at any time.
            </p>

                <a href="#quickstart_consume">Step 5: Read the events</a>
            </h4>

            <p>Open another terminal session and run the console consumer client to read the events you just created:</p>

            <p>You can stop the consumer client with <code>Ctrl-C</code> at any time.</p>

            <p>Feel free to experiment: for example, switch back to your producer terminal (previous step) to write
                additional events, and see how the events immediately show up in your consumer terminal.</p>

            <p>Because events are durably stored in Kafka, they can be read as many times and by as many consumers as you want.
                You can easily verify this by opening yet another terminal session and re-running the previous command again.</p>

                <a href="#quickstart_kafkaconnect">Step 6: Import/export your data as streams of events with Kafka Connect</a>
            </h4>

            <p>
                You probably have lots of data in existing systems like relational databases or traditional messaging systems,
                along with many applications that already use these systems.
                <a href="/documentation/#connect">Kafka Connect</a> allows you to continuously ingest
                data from external systems into Kafka, and vice versa. It is an extensible tool that runs
                <i>connectors</i>, which implement the custom logic for interacting with an external system.
                It is thus very easy to integrate existing systems with Kafka. To make this process even easier,
                there are hundreds of such connectors readily available.
            </p>

            <p>
                In this quickstart we'll see how to run Kafka Connect with simple connectors that import data
                from a file to a Kafka topic and export data from a Kafka topic to a file.
            </p>

            <p>
                First, make sure to add <code class="language-bash">connect-file-3.6.1.jar</code> to the <code>plugin.path</code> property in the Connect worker's configuration.
                For the purpose of this quickstart we'll use a relative path and consider the connectors' package as an uber jar, which works when the quickstart commands are run from the installation directory.
                However, it's worth noting that for production deployments using absolute paths is always preferable. See <a href="/documentation/#connectconfigs_plugin.path">plugin.path</a> for a detailed description of how to set this config.
            </p>

            <p>
                Edit the <code class="language-bash">config/connect-standalone.properties</code> file, add or change the <code>plugin.path</code> configuration property match the following, and save the file:
            </p>

            <pre class="brush: bash;">&gt; echo "plugin.path=libs/connect-file-3.6.1.jar"</pre>

            <p>
                Then, start by creating some seed data to test with:
            </p>

            <pre class="brush: bash;">&gt; echo -e "foo\nbar" &gt; test.txt</pre>
            Or on Windows:
            <pre class="brush: bash;">&gt; echo foo&gt; test.txt
&gt; echo bar&gt;&gt; test.txt</pre>

            <p>
                Next, we'll start two connectors running in <i>standalone</i> mode, which means they run in a single, local, dedicated
                process. We provide three configuration files as parameters. The first is always the configuration for the Kafka Connect
                process, containing common configuration such as the Kafka brokers to connect to and the serialization format for data.
                The remaining configuration files each specify a connector to create. These files include a unique connector name, the connector
                class to instantiate, and any other configuration required by the connector.
            </p>

            <pre class="brush: bash;">&gt; bin/connect-standalone.sh config/connect-standalone.properties config/connect-file-source.properties config/connect-file-sink.properties</pre>

            <p>
                These sample configuration files, included with Kafka, use the default local cluster configuration you started earlier
                and create two connectors: the first is a source connector that reads lines from an input file and produces each to a Kafka topic
                and the second is a sink connector that reads messages from a Kafka topic and produces each as a line in an output file.
            </p>

            <p>
                During startup you'll see a number of log messages, including some indicating that the connectors are being instantiated.
                Once the Kafka Connect process has started, the source connector should start reading lines from <code>test.txt</code> and
                producing them to the topic <code>connect-test</code>, and the sink connector should start reading messages from the topic <code>connect-test</code>
                and write them to the file <code>test.sink.txt</code>. We can verify the data has been delivered through the entire pipeline
                by examining the contents of the output file:
            </p>


            <pre class="brush: bash;">&gt; more test.sink.txt
foo
bar</pre>

            <p>
                Note that the data is being stored in the Kafka topic <code>connect-test</code>, so we can also run a console consumer to see the
                data in the topic (or use custom consumer code to process it):
            </p>


            <pre class="brush: bash;">&gt; bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic connect-test --from-beginning
{"schema":{"type":"string","optional":false},"payload":"foo"}
{"schema":{"type":"string","optional":false},"payload":"bar"}
...</pre>

            <p>The connectors continue to process data, so we can add data to the file and see it move through the pipeline:</p>

            <pre class="brush: bash;">&gt; echo Another line&gt;&gt; test.txt</pre>

            <p>You should see the line appear in the console consumer output and in the sink file.</p>

            </h4>

            <p>
                Once your data is stored in Kafka as events, you can process the data with the
                <a href="/documentation/streams">Kafka Streams</a> client library for Java/Scala.
                It allows you to implement mission-critical real-time applications and microservices, where the input
                and/or output data is stored in Kafka topics.  Kafka Streams combines the simplicity of writing and deploying
                standard Java and Scala applications on the client side with the benefits of Kafka's server-side cluster
                technology to make these applications highly scalable, elastic, fault-tolerant, and distributed. The library
                supports exactly-once processing, stateful operations and aggregations, windowing, joins, processing based
                on event-time, and much more.
            </p>

            <p>To give you a first taste, here's how one would implement the popular <code>WordCount</code> algorithm:</p>

    <h2 class="anchor-heading"><a id="configuration" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#configuration">3. Configuration</a></h2>



    <div class="p-configuration">
        Kafka uses key-value pairs in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties">property file format</a> for configuration. These values can be supplied either from a file or programmatically.

        <h3 class="anchor-heading"><a id="brokerconfigs" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#brokerconfigs">3.1 Broker Configs</a></h3>

        The essential configurations are the following:
        <ul>
            <li><code>broker.id</code>
            </li><li><code>log.dirs</code>
        </li><li><code>zookeeper.connect</code>
        </li></ul>

        Topic-level configurations and defaults are discussed in more detail <a href="#topicconfigs">below</a>.

        <p>..........</p>



        <p>More details about broker configuration can be found in the scala class <code>kafka.server.KafkaConfig</code>.</p>

        <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="dynamicbrokerconfigs" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#dynamicbrokerconfigs">3.1.1 Updating Broker Configs</a></h4>
        From Kafka version 1.1 onwards, some of the broker configs can be updated without restarting the broker. See the
        <code>Dynamic Update Mode</code> column in <a href="#brokerconfigs">Broker Configs</a> for the update mode of each broker config.
        <ul>
            <li><code>read-only</code>: Requires a broker restart for update</li>
            <li><code>per-broker</code>: May be updated dynamically for each broker</li>
            <li><code>cluster-wide</code>: May be updated dynamically as a cluster-wide default. May also be updated as a per-broker value for testing.</li>
        </ul>

        To alter the current broker configs for broker id 0 (for example, the number of log cleaner threads):
        <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> bin/kafka-configs.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --entity-type brokers --entity-name <span class="token number">0</span> --alter --add-config log.cleaner.threads<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token number">2</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>

        To describe the current dynamic broker configs for broker id 0:
        <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> bin/kafka-configs.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --entity-type brokers --entity-name <span class="token number">0</span> --describe<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>

        To delete a config override and revert to the statically configured or default value for broker id 0 (for example,
        the number of log cleaner threads):
        <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> bin/kafka-configs.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --entity-type brokers --entity-name <span class="token number">0</span> --alter --delete-config log.cleaner.threads<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>

        Some configs may be configured as a cluster-wide default to maintain consistent values across the whole cluster.  All brokers
        in the cluster will process the cluster default update. For example, to update log cleaner threads on all brokers:
        <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> bin/kafka-configs.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --entity-type brokers --entity-default --alter --add-config log.cleaner.threads<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token number">2</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>

        To describe the currently configured dynamic cluster-wide default configs:
        <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> bin/kafka-configs.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --entity-type brokers --entity-default --describe<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>

        All configs that are configurable at cluster level may also be configured at per-broker level (e.g. for testing).
        If a config value is defined at different levels, the following order of precedence is used:
        <ul>
            <li>Dynamic per-broker config stored in ZooKeeper</li>
            <li>Dynamic cluster-wide default config stored in ZooKeeper</li>
            <li>Static broker config from <code>server.properties</code></li>
            <li>Kafka default, see <a href="#brokerconfigs">broker configs</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Updating Password Configs Dynamically</h5>
        <p>Password config values that are dynamically updated are encrypted before storing in ZooKeeper. The broker config
            <code>password.encoder.secret</code> must be configured in <code>server.properties</code> to enable dynamic update
            of password configs. The secret may be different on different brokers.</p>
        <p>The secret used for password encoding may be rotated with a rolling restart of brokers. The old secret used for encoding
            passwords currently in ZooKeeper must be provided in the static broker config <code>password.encoder.old.secret</code> and
            the new secret must be provided in <code>password.encoder.secret</code>. All dynamic password configs stored in ZooKeeper
            will be re-encoded with the new secret when the broker starts up.</p>
        <p>In Kafka 1.1.x, all dynamically updated password configs must be provided in every alter request when updating configs
            using <code>kafka-configs.sh</code> even if the password config is not being altered. This constraint will be removed in
            a future release.</p>

        <h5>Updating Password Configs in ZooKeeper Before Starting Brokers</h5>

        From Kafka 2.0.0 onwards, <code>kafka-configs.sh</code> enables dynamic broker configs to be updated using ZooKeeper before
        starting brokers for bootstrapping. This enables all password configs to be stored in encrypted form, avoiding the need for
        clear passwords in <code>server.properties</code>. The broker config <code>password.encoder.secret</code> must also be specified
        if any password configs are included in the alter command. Additional encryption parameters may also be specified. Password
        encoder configs will not be persisted in ZooKeeper. For example, to store SSL key password for listener <code>INTERNAL</code>
        on broker 0:

        <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> bin/kafka-configs.sh --zookeeper localhost:2182 --zk-tls-config-file zk_tls_config.properties --entity-type brokers --entity-name <span class="token number">0</span> --alter --add-config
    <span class="token string">'listener.name.internal.ssl.key.password=key-password,password.encoder.secret=secret,password.encoder.iterations=8192'</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>

        The configuration <code>listener.name.internal.ssl.key.password</code> will be persisted in ZooKeeper in encrypted
        form using the provided encoder configs. The encoder secret and iterations are not persisted in ZooKeeper.

        <h5>Updating SSL Keystore of an Existing Listener</h5>
        Brokers may be configured with SSL keystores with short validity periods to reduce the risk of compromised certificates.
        Keystores may be updated dynamically without restarting the broker. The config name must be prefixed with the listener prefix
        <code>listener.name.{listenerName}.</code> so that only the keystore config of a specific listener is updated.
        The following configs may be updated in a single alter request at per-broker level:
        <ul>
            <li><code>ssl.keystore.type</code></li>
            <li><code>ssl.keystore.location</code></li>
            <li><code>ssl.keystore.password</code></li>
            <li><code>ssl.key.password</code></li>
        </ul>
        If the listener is the inter-broker listener, the update is allowed only if the new keystore is trusted by the truststore
        configured for that listener. For other listeners, no trust validation is performed on the keystore by the broker. Certificates
        must be signed by the same certificate authority that signed the old certificate to avoid any client authentication failures.

        <h5>Updating SSL Truststore of an Existing Listener</h5>
        Broker truststores may be updated dynamically without restarting the broker to add or remove certificates.
        Updated truststore will be used to authenticate new client connections. The config name must be prefixed with the
        listener prefix <code>listener.name.{listenerName}.</code> so that only the truststore config of a specific listener
        is updated. The following configs may be updated in a single alter request at per-broker level:
        <ul>
            <li><code>ssl.truststore.type</code></li>
            <li><code>ssl.truststore.location</code></li>
            <li><code>ssl.truststore.password</code></li>
        </ul>
        If the listener is the inter-broker listener, the update is allowed only if the existing keystore for that listener is trusted by
        the new truststore. For other listeners, no trust validation is performed by the broker before the update. Removal of CA certificates
        used to sign client certificates from the new truststore can lead to client authentication failures.

        <h5>Updating Default Topic Configuration</h5>
        Default topic configuration options used by brokers may be updated without broker restart. The configs are applied to topics
        without a topic config override for the equivalent per-topic config. One or more of these configs may be overridden at
        cluster-default level used by all brokers.
        <ul>
            <li><code>log.segment.bytes</code></li>
            <li><code>log.roll.ms</code></li>
            <li><code>log.roll.hours</code></li>
            <li><code>log.roll.jitter.ms</code></li>
            <li><code>log.roll.jitter.hours</code></li>
            <li><code>log.index.size.max.bytes</code></li>
            <li><code>log.flush.interval.messages</code></li>
            <li><code>log.flush.interval.ms</code></li>
            <li><code>log.retention.bytes</code></li>
            <li><code>log.retention.ms</code></li>
            <li><code>log.retention.minutes</code></li>
            <li><code>log.retention.hours</code></li>
            <li><code>log.index.interval.bytes</code></li>
            <li><code>log.cleaner.delete.retention.ms</code></li>
            <li><code>log.cleaner.min.compaction.lag.ms</code></li>
            <li><code>log.cleaner.max.compaction.lag.ms</code></li>
            <li><code>log.cleaner.min.cleanable.ratio</code></li>
            <li><code>log.cleanup.policy</code></li>
            <li><code>log.segment.delete.delay.ms</code></li>
            <li><code>unclean.leader.election.enable</code></li>
            <li><code>min.insync.replicas</code></li>
            <li><code>max.message.bytes</code></li>
            <li><code>compression.type</code></li>
            <li><code>log.preallocate</code></li>
            <li><code>log.message.timestamp.type</code></li>
            <li><code>log.message.timestamp.difference.max.ms</code></li>
        </ul>

        From Kafka version 2.0.0 onwards, unclean leader election is automatically enabled by the controller when the config
        <code>unclean.leader.election.enable</code> is dynamically updated.
        In Kafka version 1.1.x, changes to <code>unclean.leader.election.enable</code> take effect only when a new controller is elected.
        Controller re-election may be forced by running:

        <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> bin/zookeeper-shell.sh localhost
  rmr /controller<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>

        <h5>Updating Log Cleaner Configs</h5>
        Log cleaner configs may be updated dynamically at cluster-default level used by all brokers. The changes take effect
        on the next iteration of log cleaning. One or more of these configs may be updated:
        <ul>
            <li><code>log.cleaner.threads</code></li>
            <li><code>log.cleaner.io.max.bytes.per.second</code></li>
            <li><code>log.cleaner.dedupe.buffer.size</code></li>
            <li><code>log.cleaner.io.buffer.size</code></li>
            <li><code>log.cleaner.io.buffer.load.factor</code></li>
            <li><code>log.cleaner.backoff.ms</code></li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Updating Thread Configs</h5>
        The size of various thread pools used by the broker may be updated dynamically at cluster-default level used by all brokers.
        Updates are restricted to the range <code>currentSize / 2</code> to <code>currentSize * 2</code> to ensure that config updates are
        handled gracefully.
        <ul>
            <li><code>num.network.threads</code></li>
            <li><code>num.io.threads</code></li>
            <li><code>num.replica.fetchers</code></li>
            <li><code>num.recovery.threads.per.data.dir</code></li>
            <li><code>log.cleaner.threads</code></li>
            <li><code>background.threads</code></li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Updating ConnectionQuota Configs</h5>
        The maximum number of connections allowed for a given IP/host by the broker may be updated dynamically at cluster-default level used by all brokers.
        The changes will apply for new connection creations and the existing connections count will be taken into account by the new limits.
        <ul>
            <li><code>max.connections.per.ip</code></li>
            <li><code>max.connections.per.ip.overrides</code></li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Adding and Removing Listeners</h5>
        <p>Listeners may be added or removed dynamically. When a new listener is added, security configs of the listener must be provided
            as listener configs with the listener prefix <code>listener.name.{listenerName}.</code>. If the new listener uses SASL,
            the JAAS configuration of the listener must be provided using the JAAS configuration property <code>sasl.jaas.config</code>
            with the listener and mechanism prefix. See <a href="#security_jaas_broker">JAAS configuration for Kafka brokers</a> for details.</p>

        <p>In Kafka version 1.1.x, the listener used by the inter-broker listener may not be updated dynamically. To update the inter-broker
            listener to a new listener, the new listener may be added on all brokers without restarting the broker. A rolling restart is then
            required to update <code>inter.broker.listener.name</code>.</p>

        In addition to all the security configs of new listeners, the following configs may be updated dynamically at per-broker level:
        <ul>
            <li><code>listeners</code></li>
            <li><code>advertised.listeners</code></li>
            <li><code>listener.security.protocol.map</code></li>
        </ul>
        Inter-broker listener must be configured using the static broker configuration <code>inter.broker.listener.name</code>
        or <code>security.inter.broker.protocol</code>.

        <h3 class="anchor-heading"><a id="topicconfigs" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#topicconfigs">3.2 Topic-Level Configs</a></h3>

        Configurations pertinent to topics have both a server default as well an optional per-topic override. If no per-topic configuration is given the server default is used. The override can be set at topic creation time by giving one or more <code>--config</code> options. This example creates a topic named <i>my-topic</i> with a custom max message size and flush rate:
        <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> bin/kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --create --topic my-topic --partitions <span class="token number">1</span> <span class="token punctuation">\</span>

        <h3 class="anchor-heading"><a id="majordesignelements" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#majordesignelements">4.1 Motivation</a></h3>
        <p>
            We designed Kafka to be able to act as a unified platform for handling all the real-time data feeds <a href="#introduction">a large company might have</a>. To do this we had to think through a fairly broad set of use cases.
        </p><p>
        It would have to have high-throughput to support high volume event streams such as real-time log aggregation.
    </p><p>
        It would need to deal gracefully with large data backlogs to be able to support periodic data loads from offline systems.
    </p><p>
        It also meant the system would have to handle low-latency delivery to handle more traditional messaging use-cases.
    </p><p>
        We wanted to support partitioned, distributed, real-time processing of these feeds to create new, derived feeds. This motivated our partitioning and consumer model.
    </p><p>
        Finally in cases where the stream is fed into other data systems for serving, we knew the system would have to be able to guarantee fault-tolerance in the presence of machine failures.
    </p><p>
        Supporting these uses led us to a design with a number of unique elements, more akin to a database log than a traditional messaging system. We will outline some elements of the design in the following sections.

    </p><h3 class="anchor-heading"><a id="persistence" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#persistence">4.2 Persistence</a></h3>
        <h4><a id="design_filesystem" href="#design_filesystem">Don't fear the filesystem!</a></h4>
        <p>
            Kafka relies heavily on the filesystem for storing and caching messages. There is a general perception that "disks are slow" which makes people skeptical that a persistent structure can offer competitive performance.
            In fact disks are both much slower and much faster than people expect depending on how they are used; and a properly designed disk structure can often be as fast as the network.
        </p><p>
        The key fact about disk performance is that the throughput of hard drives has been diverging from the latency of a disk seek for the last decade. As a result the performance of linear writes on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-RAID_drive_architectures">JBOD</a>
        configuration with six 7200rpm SATA RAID-5 array is about 600MB/sec but the performance of random writes is only about 100k/sec—a difference of over 6000X. These linear reads and writes are the most
        predictable of all usage patterns, and are heavily optimized by the operating system. A modern operating system provides read-ahead and write-behind techniques that prefetch data in large block multiples and
        group smaller logical writes into large physical writes. A further discussion of this issue can be found in this <a href="http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1563874">ACM Queue article</a>; they actually find that
        <a href="http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/1570000/1563874/jacobs3.jpg">sequential disk access can in some cases be faster than random memory access!</a>
    </p><p>
        To compensate for this performance divergence, modern operating systems have become increasingly aggressive in their use of main memory for disk caching. A modern OS will happily divert <i>all</i> free memory to
        disk caching with little performance penalty when the memory is reclaimed. All disk reads and writes will go through this unified cache. This feature cannot easily be turned off without using direct I/O, so even
        if a process maintains an in-process cache of the data, this data will likely be duplicated in OS pagecache, effectively storing everything twice.
    </p><p>
        Furthermore, we are building on top of the JVM, and anyone who has spent any time with Java memory usage knows two things:
    </p><ol>
        <li>The memory overhead of objects is very high, often doubling the size of the data stored (or worse).</li>
        <li>Java garbage collection becomes increasingly fiddly and slow as the in-heap data increases.</li>
    </ol>
        <p>
            As a result of these factors using the filesystem and relying on pagecache is superior to maintaining an in-memory cache or other structure—we at least double the available cache by having automatic access
            to all free memory, and likely double again by storing a compact byte structure rather than individual objects. Doing so will result in a cache of up to 28-30GB on a 32GB machine without GC penalties.
            Furthermore, this cache will stay warm even if the service is restarted, whereas the in-process cache will need to be rebuilt in memory (which for a 10GB cache may take 10 minutes) or else it will need to start
            with a completely cold cache (which likely means terrible initial performance). This also greatly simplifies the code as all logic for maintaining coherency between the cache and filesystem is now in the OS,
            which tends to do so more efficiently and more correctly than one-off in-process attempts. If your disk usage favors linear reads then read-ahead is effectively pre-populating this cache with useful data on each
            disk read.
        </p><p>
        This suggests a design which is very simple: rather than maintain as much as possible in-memory and flush it all out to the filesystem in a panic when we run out of space, we invert that. All data is immediately
        written to a persistent log on the filesystem without necessarily flushing to disk. In effect this just means that it is transferred into the kernel's pagecache.
    </p><p>
        This style of pagecache-centric design is described in an <a href="http://varnish-cache.org/wiki/ArchitectNotes">article</a> on the design of Varnish here (along with a healthy dose of arrogance).

    </p><h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="design_constanttime" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#design_constanttime">Constant Time Suffices</a></h4>
        <p>
            The persistent data structure used in messaging systems are often a per-consumer queue with an associated BTree or other general-purpose random access data structures to maintain metadata about messages.
            BTrees are the most versatile data structure available, and make it possible to support a wide variety of transactional and non-transactional semantics in the messaging system.
            They do come with a fairly high cost, though: Btree operations are O(log N). Normally O(log N) is considered essentially equivalent to constant time, but this is not true for disk operations.
            Disk seeks come at 10 ms a pop, and each disk can do only one seek at a time so parallelism is limited. Hence even a handful of disk seeks leads to very high overhead.
            Since storage systems mix very fast cached operations with very slow physical disk operations, the observed performance of tree structures is often superlinear as data increases with fixed cache--i.e. doubling
            your data makes things much worse than twice as slow.
        </p><p>
        Intuitively a persistent queue could be built on simple reads and appends to files as is commonly the case with logging solutions. This structure has the advantage that all operations are O(1) and reads do not
        block writes or each other. This has obvious performance advantages since the performance is completely decoupled from the data size—one server can now take full advantage of a number of cheap,
        low-rotational speed 1+TB SATA drives. Though they have poor seek performance, these drives have acceptable performance for large reads and writes and come at 1/3 the price and 3x the capacity.
    </p><p>
        Having access to virtually unlimited disk space without any performance penalty means that we can provide some features not usually found in a messaging system. For example, in Kafka, instead of attempting to
        delete messages as soon as they are consumed, we can retain messages for a relatively long period (say a week). This leads to a great deal of flexibility for consumers, as we will describe.

    </p><h3 class="anchor-heading"><a id="maximizingefficiency" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#maximizingefficiency">4.3 Efficiency</a></h3>
        <p>
            We have put significant effort into efficiency. One of our primary use cases is handling web activity data, which is very high volume: each page view may generate dozens of writes. Furthermore, we assume each
            message published is read by at least one consumer (often many), hence we strive to make consumption as cheap as possible.
        </p><p>
        We have also found, from experience building and running a number of similar systems, that efficiency is a key to effective multi-tenant operations. If the downstream infrastructure service can easily become a
        bottleneck due to a small bump in usage by the application, such small changes will often create problems. By being very fast we help ensure that the application will tip-over under load before the infrastructure.
        This is particularly important when trying to run a centralized service that supports dozens or hundreds of applications on a centralized cluster as changes in usage patterns are a near-daily occurrence.
    </p><p>
        We discussed disk efficiency in the previous section. Once poor disk access patterns have been eliminated, there are two common causes of inefficiency in this type of system: too many small I/O operations, and
        excessive byte copying.
    </p><p>
        The small I/O problem happens both between the client and the server and in the server's own persistent operations.
    </p><p>
        To avoid this, our protocol is built around a "message set" abstraction that naturally groups messages together. This allows network requests to group messages together and amortize the overhead of the network
        roundtrip rather than sending a single message at a time. The server in turn appends chunks of messages to its log in one go, and the consumer fetches large linear chunks at a time.
    </p><p>
        This simple optimization produces orders of magnitude speed up. Batching leads to larger network packets, larger sequential disk operations, contiguous memory blocks, and so on, all of which allows Kafka to turn
        a bursty stream of random message writes into linear writes that flow to the consumers.
    </p><p>
        The other inefficiency is in byte copying. At low message rates this is not an issue, but under load the impact is significant. To avoid this we employ a standardized binary message format that is shared by the
        producer, the broker, and the consumer (so data chunks can be transferred without modification between them).
    </p><p>
        The message log maintained by the broker is itself just a directory of files, each populated by a sequence of message sets that have been written to disk in the same format used by the producer and consumer.
        Maintaining this common format allows optimization of the most important operation: network transfer of persistent log chunks. Modern unix operating systems offer a highly optimized code path for transferring data
        out of pagecache to a socket; in Linux this is done with the <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sendfile.2.html">sendfile system call</a>.
    </p><p>
        To understand the impact of sendfile, it is important to understand the common data path for transfer of data from file to socket:
    </p><ol>
        <li>The operating system reads data from the disk into pagecache in kernel space</li>
        <li>The application reads the data from kernel space into a user-space buffer</li>
        <li>The application writes the data back into kernel space into a socket buffer</li>
        <li>The operating system copies the data from the socket buffer to the NIC buffer where it is sent over the network</li>
    </ol>
        <p>
            This is clearly inefficient, there are four copies and two system calls. Using sendfile, this re-copying is avoided by allowing the OS to send the data from pagecache to the network directly. So in this optimized
            path, only the final copy to the NIC buffer is needed.
        </p><p>
        We expect a common use case to be multiple consumers on a topic. Using the zero-copy optimization above, data is copied into pagecache exactly once and reused on each consumption instead of being stored in memory
        and copied out to user-space every time it is read. This allows messages to be consumed at a rate that approaches the limit of the network connection.
    </p><p>
        This combination of pagecache and sendfile means that on a Kafka cluster where the consumers are mostly caught up you will see no read activity on the disks whatsoever as they will be serving data entirely from cache.
    </p><p>
        TLS/SSL libraries operate at the user space (in-kernel <code>SSL_sendfile</code> is currently not supported by Kafka). Due to this restriction, <code>sendfile</code> is not used when SSL is enabled. For enabling
        SSL configuration, refer to <code>security.protocol</code> and <code>security.inter.broker.protocol</code>
    </p><p>
        For more background on the sendfile and zero-copy support in Java, see this <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/articles/j-zerocopy/">article</a>.

    </p><h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="design_compression" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#design_compression">End-to-end Batch Compression</a></h4>
        <p>
            In some cases the bottleneck is actually not CPU or disk but network bandwidth. This is particularly true for a data pipeline that needs to send messages between data centers over a wide-area network. Of course,
            the user can always compress its messages one at a time without any support needed from Kafka, but this can lead to very poor compression ratios as much of the redundancy is due to repetition between messages of
            the same type (e.g. field names in JSON or user agents in web logs or common string values). Efficient compression requires compressing multiple messages together rather than compressing each message individually.
        </p><p>
        Kafka supports this with an efficient batching format. A batch of messages can be clumped together compressed and sent to the server in this form. This batch of messages will be written in compressed form and will
        remain compressed in the log and will only be decompressed by the consumer.
    </p><p>
        Kafka supports GZIP, Snappy, LZ4 and ZStandard compression protocols. More details on compression can be found <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Compression">here</a>.

    </p><h3 class="anchor-heading"><a id="theproducer" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#theproducer">4.4 The Producer</a></h3>

        <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="design_loadbalancing" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#design_loadbalancing">Load balancing</a></h4>
        <p>
            The producer sends data directly to the broker that is the leader for the partition without any intervening routing tier. To help the producer do this all Kafka nodes can answer a request for metadata about which
            servers are alive and where the leaders for the partitions of a topic are at any given time to allow the producer to appropriately direct its requests.
        </p><p>
        The client controls which partition it publishes messages to. This can be done at random, implementing a kind of random load balancing, or it can be done by some semantic partitioning function. We expose the interface
        for semantic partitioning by allowing the user to specify a key to partition by and using this to hash to a partition (there is also an option to override the partition function if need be). For example if the key
        chosen was a user id then all data for a given user would be sent to the same partition. This in turn will allow consumers to make locality assumptions about their consumption. This style of partitioning is explicitly
        designed to allow locality-sensitive processing in consumers.

    </p><h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="design_asyncsend" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#design_asyncsend">Asynchronous send</a></h4>
        <p>
            Batching is one of the big drivers of efficiency, and to enable batching the Kafka producer will attempt to accumulate data in memory and to send out larger batches in a single request. The batching can be configured
            to accumulate no more than a fixed number of messages and to wait no longer than some fixed latency bound (say 64k or 10 ms). This allows the accumulation of more bytes to send, and few larger I/O operations on the
            servers. This buffering is configurable and gives a mechanism to trade off a small amount of additional latency for better throughput.
        </p><p>

    </p><h3 class="anchor-heading"><a id="theconsumer" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#theconsumer">4.5 The Consumer</a></h3>

        The Kafka consumer works by issuing "fetch" requests to the brokers leading the partitions it wants to consume. The consumer specifies its offset in the log with each request and receives back a chunk of log
        beginning from that position. The consumer thus has significant control over this position and can rewind it to re-consume data if need be.

        <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="design_pull" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#design_pull">Push vs. pull</a></h4>
        <p>
            An initial question we considered is whether consumers should pull data from brokers or brokers should push data to the consumer. In this respect Kafka follows a more traditional design, shared by most messaging
            systems, where data is pushed to the broker from the producer and pulled from the broker by the consumer. Some logging-centric systems, such as <a href="http://github.com/facebook/scribe">Scribe</a> and
            <a href="http://flume.apache.org/">Apache Flume</a>, follow a very different push-based path where data is pushed downstream. There are pros and cons to both approaches. However, a push-based system has difficulty
            dealing with diverse consumers as the broker controls the rate at which data is transferred. The goal is generally for the consumer to be able to consume at the maximum possible rate; unfortunately, in a push
            system this means the consumer tends to be overwhelmed when its rate of consumption falls below the rate of production (a denial of service attack, in essence). A pull-based system has the nicer property that
            the consumer simply falls behind and catches up when it can. This can be mitigated with some kind of backoff protocol by which the consumer can indicate it is overwhelmed, but getting the rate of transfer to
            fully utilize (but never over-utilize) the consumer is trickier than it seems. Previous attempts at building systems in this fashion led us to go with a more traditional pull model.
        </p><p>
        Another advantage of a pull-based system is that it lends itself to aggressive batching of data sent to the consumer. A push-based system must choose to either send a request immediately or accumulate more data
        and then send it later without knowledge of whether the downstream consumer will be able to immediately process it. If tuned for low latency, this will result in sending a single message at a time only for the
        transfer to end up being buffered anyway, which is wasteful. A pull-based design fixes this as the consumer always pulls all available messages after its current position in the log (or up to some configurable max
        size). So one gets optimal batching without introducing unnecessary latency.
    </p><p>
        The deficiency of a naive pull-based system is that if the broker has no data the consumer may end up polling in a tight loop, effectively busy-waiting for data to arrive. To avoid this we have parameters in our
        pull request that allow the consumer request to block in a "long poll" waiting until data arrives (and optionally waiting until a given number of bytes is available to ensure large transfer sizes).
    </p><p>
        You could imagine other possible designs which would be only pull, end-to-end. The producer would locally write to a local log, and brokers would pull from that with consumers pulling from them. A similar type of
        "store-and-forward" producer is often proposed. This is intriguing but we felt not very suitable for our target use cases which have thousands of producers. Our experience running persistent data systems at
        scale led us to feel that involving thousands of disks in the system across many applications would not actually make things more reliable and would be a nightmare to operate. And in practice we have found that we
        can run a pipeline with strong SLAs at large scale without a need for producer persistence.

    </p><h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="design_consumerposition" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#design_consumerposition">Consumer Position</a></h4>
        Keeping track of <i>what</i> has been consumed is, surprisingly, one of the key performance points of a messaging system.
        <p>
            Most messaging systems keep metadata about what messages have been consumed on the broker. That is, as a message is handed out to a consumer, the broker either records that fact locally immediately or it may wait
            for acknowledgement from the consumer. This is a fairly intuitive choice, and indeed for a single machine server it is not clear where else this state could go. Since the data structures used for storage in many
            messaging systems scale poorly, this is also a pragmatic choice--since the broker knows what is consumed it can immediately delete it, keeping the data size small.
        </p><p>
        What is perhaps not obvious is that getting the broker and consumer to come into agreement about what has been consumed is not a trivial problem. If the broker records a message as <b>consumed</b> immediately every
        time it is handed out over the network, then if the consumer fails to process the message (say because it crashes or the request times out or whatever) that message will be lost. To solve this problem, many messaging
        systems add an acknowledgement feature which means that messages are only marked as <b>sent</b> not <b>consumed</b> when they are sent; the broker waits for a specific acknowledgement from the consumer to record the
        message as <b>consumed</b>. This strategy fixes the problem of losing messages, but creates new problems. First of all, if the consumer processes the message but fails before it can send an acknowledgement then the
        message will be consumed twice. The second problem is around performance, now the broker must keep multiple states about every single message (first to lock it so it is not given out a second time, and then to mark
        it as permanently consumed so that it can be removed). Tricky problems must be dealt with, like what to do with messages that are sent but never acknowledged.
    </p><p>
        Kafka handles this differently. Our topic is divided into a set of totally ordered partitions, each of which is consumed by exactly one consumer within each subscribing consumer group at any given time. This means
        that the position of a consumer in each partition is just a single integer, the offset of the next message to consume. This makes the state about what has been consumed very small, just one number for each partition.
        This state can be periodically checkpointed. This makes the equivalent of message acknowledgements very cheap.
    </p><p>
        There is a side benefit of this decision. A consumer can deliberately <i>rewind</i> back to an old offset and re-consume data. This violates the common contract of a queue, but turns out to be an essential feature
        for many consumers. For example, if the consumer code has a bug and is discovered after some messages are consumed, the consumer can re-consume those messages once the bug is fixed.

        Scalable persistence allows for the possibility of consumers that only periodically consume such as batch data loads that periodically bulk-load data into an offline system such as Hadoop or a relational data
        warehouse.
        <p>
            In the case of Hadoop we parallelize the data load by splitting the load over individual map tasks, one for each node/topic/partition combination, allowing full parallelism in the loading. Hadoop provides the task
            management, and tasks which fail can restart without danger of duplicate data—they simply restart from their original position.

        </p><h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="static_membership" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#static_membership">Static Membership</a></h4>
        Static membership aims to improve the availability of stream applications, consumer groups and other applications built on top of the group rebalance protocol.
        The rebalance protocol relies on the group coordinator to allocate entity ids to group members. These generated ids are ephemeral and will change when members restart and rejoin.
        For consumer based apps, this "dynamic membership" can cause a large percentage of tasks re-assigned to different instances during administrative operations
        such as code deploys, configuration updates and periodic restarts. For large state applications, shuffled tasks need a long time to recover their local states before processing
        and cause applications to be partially or entirely unavailable. Motivated by this observation, Kafka’s group management protocol allows group members to provide persistent entity ids.
        Group membership remains unchanged based on those ids, thus no rebalance will be triggered.
        <p>
            If you want to use static membership,
        </p><ul>
        <li>Upgrade both broker cluster and client apps to 2.3 or beyond, and also make sure the upgraded brokers are using <code>inter.broker.protocol.version</code>
            of 2.3 or beyond as well.</li>
        <li>Set the config <code>ConsumerConfig#GROUP_INSTANCE_ID_CONFIG</code> to a unique value for each consumer instance under one group.</li>
        <li>For Kafka Streams applications, it is sufficient to set a unique <code>ConsumerConfig#GROUP_INSTANCE_ID_CONFIG</code> per KafkaStreams instance,
            independent of the number of used threads for an instance.</li>
    </ul>
        If your broker is on an older version than 2.3, but you choose to set <code>ConsumerConfig#GROUP_INSTANCE_ID_CONFIG</code> on the client side, the application will detect
        the broker version and then throws an UnsupportedException. If you accidentally configure duplicate ids for different instances,
        a fencing mechanism on broker side will inform your duplicate client to shutdown immediately by triggering a <code>org.apache.kafka.common.errors.FencedInstanceIdException</code>.

        <h3 class="anchor-heading"><a id="semantics" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#semantics">4.6 Message Delivery Semantics</a></h3>
        <p>
            Now that we understand a little about how producers and consumers work, let's discuss the semantic guarantees Kafka provides between producer and consumer. Clearly there are multiple possible message delivery
            guarantees that could be provided:
        </p><ul>
        <li>
            <i>At most once</i>—Messages may be lost but are never redelivered.
        </li>
        <li>
            <i>At least once</i>—Messages are never lost but may be redelivered.
        </li>
        <li>
            <i>Exactly once</i>—this is what people actually want, each message is delivered once and only once.
        </li>
    </ul>

        It's worth noting that this breaks down into two problems: the durability guarantees for publishing a message and the guarantees when consuming a message.
        <p>
            Many systems claim to provide "exactly once" delivery semantics, but it is important to read the fine print, most of these claims are misleading (i.e. they don't translate to the case where consumers or producers
            can fail, cases where there are multiple consumer processes, or cases where data written to disk can be lost).
        </p><p>
        Kafka's semantics are straight-forward. When publishing a message we have a notion of the message being "committed" to the log. Once a published message is committed it will not be lost as long as one broker that
        replicates the partition to which this message was written remains "alive". The definition of committed message, alive partition as well as a description of which types of failures we attempt to handle will be
        described in more detail in the next section. For now let's assume a perfect, lossless broker and try to understand the guarantees to the producer and consumer. If a producer attempts to publish a message and
        experiences a network error it cannot be sure if this error happened before or after the message was committed. This is similar to the semantics of inserting into a database table with an autogenerated key.
    </p><p>
        Prior to 0.11.0.0, if a producer failed to receive a response indicating that a message was committed, it had little choice but to resend the message. This provides at-least-once delivery semantics since the
        message may be written to the log again during resending if the original request had in fact succeeded. Since 0.11.0.0, the Kafka producer also supports an idempotent delivery option which guarantees that resending
        will not result in duplicate entries in the log. To achieve this, the broker assigns each producer an ID and deduplicates messages using a sequence number that is sent by the producer along with every message.
        Also beginning with 0.11.0.0, the producer supports the ability to send messages to multiple topic partitions using transaction-like semantics: i.e. either all messages are successfully written or none of them are.
        The main use case for this is exactly-once processing between Kafka topics (described below).
    </p><p>
        Not all use cases require such strong guarantees. For uses which are latency sensitive we allow the producer to specify the durability level it desires. If the producer specifies that it wants to wait on the message
        being committed this can take on the order of 10 ms. However the producer can also specify that it wants to perform the send completely asynchronously or that it wants to wait only until the leader (but not
        necessarily the followers) have the message.
    </p><p>
        Now let's describe the semantics from the point-of-view of the consumer. All replicas have the exact same log with the same offsets. The consumer controls its position in this log. If the consumer never crashed it
        could just store this position in memory, but if the consumer fails and we want this topic partition to be taken over by another process the new process will need to choose an appropriate position from which to start
        processing. Let's say the consumer reads some messages -- it has several options for processing the messages and updating its position.
    </p><ol>
        <li>It can read the messages, then save its position in the log, and finally process the messages. In this case there is a possibility that the consumer process crashes after saving its position but before saving
            the output of its message processing. In this case the process that took over processing would start at the saved position even though a few messages prior to that position had not been processed. This corresponds
            to "at-most-once" semantics as in the case of a consumer failure messages may not be processed.
        </li><li>It can read the messages, process the messages, and finally save its position. In this case there is a possibility that the consumer process crashes after processing messages but before saving its position.
        In this case when the new process takes over the first few messages it receives will already have been processed. This corresponds to the "at-least-once" semantics in the case of consumer failure. In many cases
        messages have a primary key and so the updates are idempotent (receiving the same message twice just overwrites a record with another copy of itself).
    </li></ol>
        <p>
            So what about exactly once semantics (i.e. the thing you actually want)? When consuming from a Kafka topic and producing to another topic (as in a <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams">Kafka Streams</a>
            application), we can leverage the new transactional producer capabilities in 0.11.0.0 that were mentioned above. The consumer's position is stored as a message in a topic, so we can write the offset to Kafka in the
            same transaction as the output topics receiving the processed data. If the transaction is aborted, the consumer's position will revert to its old value and the produced data on the output topics will not be visible
            to other consumers, depending on their "isolation level." In the default "read_uncommitted" isolation level, all messages are visible to consumers even if they were part of an aborted transaction,
            but in "read_committed," the consumer will only return messages from transactions which were committed (and any messages which were not part of a transaction).
        </p><p>
        When writing to an external system, the limitation is in the need to coordinate the consumer's position with what is actually stored as output. The classic way of achieving this would be to introduce a two-phase
        commit between the storage of the consumer position and the storage of the consumers output. But this can be handled more simply and generally by letting the consumer store its offset in the same place as
        its output. This is better because many of the output systems a consumer might want to write to will not support a two-phase commit. As an example of this, consider a
        <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connect">Kafka Connect</a> connector which populates data in HDFS along with the offsets of the data it reads so that it is guaranteed that either data and
        offsets are both updated or neither is. We follow similar patterns for many other data systems which require these stronger semantics and for which the messages do not have a primary key to allow for deduplication.
    </p><p>
        So effectively Kafka supports exactly-once delivery in <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams">Kafka Streams</a>, and the transactional producer/consumer can be used generally to provide
        exactly-once delivery when transferring and processing data between Kafka topics. Exactly-once delivery for other destination systems generally requires cooperation with such systems, but Kafka provides the
        offset which makes implementing this feasible (see also <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connect">Kafka Connect</a>). Otherwise, Kafka guarantees at-least-once delivery by default, and allows
        the user to implement at-most-once delivery by disabling retries on the producer and committing offsets in the consumer prior to processing a batch of messages.

    </p><h3 class="anchor-heading"><a id="replication" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#replication">4.7 Replication</a></h3>
        <p>
            Kafka replicates the log for each topic's partitions across a configurable number of servers (you can set this replication factor on a topic-by-topic basis). This allows automatic failover to these replicas when a
            server in the cluster fails so messages remain available in the presence of failures.
        </p><p>
        Other messaging systems provide some replication-related features, but, in our (totally biased) opinion, this appears to be a tacked-on thing, not heavily used, and with large downsides: replicas are inactive,
        throughput is heavily impacted, it requires fiddly manual configuration, etc. Kafka is meant to be used with replication by default—in fact we implement un-replicated topics as replicated topics where the
        replication factor is one.
    </p><p>
        The unit of replication is the topic partition. Under non-failure conditions, each partition in Kafka has a single leader and zero or more followers. The total number of replicas including the leader constitute the
        replication factor. All writes go to the leader of the partition, and reads can go to the leader or the followers of the partition. Typically, there are many more partitions than brokers and the leaders are evenly distributed among brokers. The logs on the followers are
        identical to the leader's log—all have the same offsets and messages in the same order (though, of course, at any given time the leader may have a few as-yet unreplicated messages at the end of its log).
    </p><p>
        Followers consume messages from the leader just as a normal Kafka consumer would and apply them to their own log. Having the followers pull from the leader has the nice property of allowing the follower to naturally
        batch together log entries they are applying to their log.
    </p><p>
        As with most distributed systems, automatically handling failures requires a precise definition of what it means for a node to be "alive." In Kafka, a special node
        known as the "controller" is responsible for managing the registration of brokers in the cluster. Broker liveness has two conditions:
    </p><ol>
        <li>Brokers must maintain an active session with the controller in order to receive regular metadata updates.</li>
        <li>Brokers acting as followers must replicate the writes from the leader and not fall "too far" behind.</li>
    </ol>
        <p>
            What is meant by an "active session" depends on the cluster configuration. For KRaft clusters, an active session is maintained by
            sending periodic heartbeats to the controller. If the controller fails to receive a heartbeat before the timeout configured by
            <code>broker.session.timeout.ms</code> expires, then the node is considered offline.
        </p><p>
        For clusters using Zookeeper, liveness is determined indirectly through the existence of an ephemeral node which is created by the broker on
        initialization of its Zookeeper session. If the broker loses its session after failing to send heartbeats to Zookeeper before expiration of
        <code>zookeeper.session.timeout.ms</code>, then the node gets deleted. The controller would then notice the node deletion through a Zookeeper watch
        and mark the broker offline.
    </p><p>
        We refer to nodes satisfying these two conditions as being "in sync" to avoid the vagueness of "alive" or "failed". The leader keeps track of the set of "in sync" replicas,
        which is known as the ISR. If either of these conditions fail to be satisfied, then the broker will be removed from the ISR. For example,
        if a follower dies, then the controller will notice the failure through the loss of its session, and will remove the broker from the ISR.
        On the other hand, if the follower lags too far behind the leader but still has an active session, then the leader can also remove it from the ISR.
        The determination of lagging replicas is controlled through the <code>replica.lag.time.max.ms</code> configuration.
        Replicas that cannot catch up to the end of the log on the leader within the max time set by this configuration are removed from the ISR.
    </p><p>
        In distributed systems terminology we only attempt to handle a "fail/recover" model of failures where nodes suddenly cease working and then later recover (perhaps without knowing that they have died). Kafka does not
        handle so-called "Byzantine" failures in which nodes produce arbitrary or malicious responses (perhaps due to bugs or foul play).
    </p><p>
        We can now more precisely define that a message is considered committed when all replicas in the ISR for that partition have applied it to their log.
        Only committed messages are ever given out to the consumer. This means that the consumer need not worry about potentially seeing a message that could be lost if the leader fails. Producers, on the other hand,
        have the option of either waiting for the message to be committed or not, depending on their preference for tradeoff between latency and durability. This preference is controlled by the acks setting that the
        producer uses.
        Note that topics have a setting for the "minimum number" of in-sync replicas that is checked when the producer requests acknowledgment that a message
        has been written to the full set of in-sync replicas. If a less stringent acknowledgement is requested by the producer, then the message can be committed, and consumed,
        even if the number of in-sync replicas is lower than the minimum (e.g. it can be as low as just the leader).
    </p><p>
        The guarantee that Kafka offers is that a committed message will not be lost, as long as there is at least one in sync replica alive, at all times.
    </p><p>
        Kafka will remain available in the presence of node failures after a short fail-over period, but may not remain available in the presence of network partitions.

    </p><h4><a id="design_replicatedlog" href="#design_replicatedlog">Replicated Logs: Quorums, ISRs, and State Machines (Oh my!)</a></h4>

        At its heart a Kafka partition is a replicated log. The replicated log is one of the most basic primitives in distributed data systems, and there are many approaches for implementing one. A replicated log can be
        used by other systems as a primitive for implementing other distributed systems in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_machine_replication">state-machine style</a>.
        <p>
            A replicated log models the process of coming into consensus on the order of a series of values (generally numbering the log entries 0, 1, 2, ...). There are many ways to implement this, but the simplest and fastest
            is with a leader who chooses the ordering of values provided to it. As long as the leader remains alive, all followers need to only copy the values and ordering the leader chooses.
        </p><p>
        Of course if leaders didn't fail we wouldn't need followers! When the leader does die we need to choose a new leader from among the followers. But followers themselves may fall behind or crash so we must ensure we
        choose an up-to-date follower. The fundamental guarantee a log replication algorithm must provide is that if we tell the client a message is committed, and the leader fails, the new leader we elect must also have
        that message. This yields a tradeoff: if the leader waits for more followers to acknowledge a message before declaring it committed then there will be more potentially electable leaders.
    </p><p>
        If you choose the number of acknowledgements required and the number of logs that must be compared to elect a leader such that there is guaranteed to be an overlap, then this is called a Quorum.
    </p><p>
        A common approach to this tradeoff is to use a majority vote for both the commit decision and the leader election. This is not what Kafka does, but let's explore it anyway to understand the tradeoffs. Let's say we
        have 2<i>f</i>+1 replicas. If <i>f</i>+1 replicas must receive a message prior to a commit being declared by the leader, and if we elect a new leader by electing the follower with the most complete log from at least
        <i>f</i>+1 replicas, then, with no more than <i>f</i> failures, the leader is guaranteed to have all committed messages. This is because among any <i>f</i>+1 replicas, there must be at least one replica that contains
        all committed messages. That replica's log will be the most complete and therefore will be selected as the new leader. There are many remaining details that each algorithm must handle (such as precisely defined what
        makes a log more complete, ensuring log consistency during leader failure or changing the set of servers in the replica set) but we will ignore these for now.
    </p><p>
        This majority vote approach has a very nice property: the latency is dependent on only the fastest servers. That is, if the replication factor is three, the latency is determined by the faster follower not the slower one.
    </p><p>
        There are a rich variety of algorithms in this family including ZooKeeper's
        <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140602093727/http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs347/reading/zab.pdf">Zab</a>,
        <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/atc14/atc14-paper-ongaro.pdf">Raft</a>,
        and <a href="http://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/vr-revisited.pdf">Viewstamped Replication</a>.
        The most similar academic publication we are aware of to Kafka's actual implementation is
        <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=66814">PacificA</a> from Microsoft.
    </p><p>
        The downside of majority vote is that it doesn't take many failures to leave you with no electable leaders. To tolerate one failure requires three copies of the data, and to tolerate two failures requires five copies
        of the data. In our experience having only enough redundancy to tolerate a single failure is not enough for a practical system, but doing every write five times, with 5x the disk space requirements and 1/5th the
        throughput, is not very practical for large volume data problems. This is likely why quorum algorithms more commonly appear for shared cluster configuration such as ZooKeeper but are less common for primary data
        storage. For example in HDFS the namenode's high-availability feature is built on a <a href="http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2012/10/quorum-based-journaling-in-cdh4-1">majority-vote-based journal</a>, but this more
        expensive approach is not used for the data itself.
    </p><p>
        Kafka takes a slightly different approach to choosing its quorum set. Instead of majority vote, Kafka dynamically maintains a set of in-sync replicas (ISR) that are caught-up to the leader. Only members of this set
        are eligible for election as leader. A write to a Kafka partition is not considered committed until <i>all</i> in-sync replicas have received the write. This ISR set is persisted in the cluster metadata whenever it changes.
        Because of this, any replica in the ISR is eligible to be elected leader. This is an important factor for Kafka's usage model where there are many partitions and ensuring leadership balance is important.
        With this ISR model and <i>f+1</i> replicas, a Kafka topic can tolerate <i>f</i> failures without losing committed messages.
    </p><p>
        For most use cases we hope to handle, we think this tradeoff is a reasonable one. In practice, to tolerate <i>f</i> failures, both the majority vote and the ISR approach will wait for the same number of replicas to
        acknowledge before committing a message (e.g. to survive one failure a majority quorum needs three replicas and one acknowledgement and the ISR approach requires two replicas and one acknowledgement).
        The ability to commit without the slowest servers is an advantage of the majority vote approach. However, we think it is ameliorated by allowing the client to choose whether they block on the message commit or not,
        and the additional throughput and disk space due to the lower required replication factor is worth it.
    </p><p>
        Another important design distinction is that Kafka does not require that crashed nodes recover with all their data intact. It is not uncommon for replication algorithms in this space to depend on the existence of
        "stable storage" that cannot be lost in any failure-recovery scenario without potential consistency violations. There are two primary problems with this assumption. First, disk errors are the most common problem we
        observe in real operation of persistent data systems and they often do not leave data intact. Secondly, even if this were not a problem, we do not want to require the use of fsync on every write for our consistency
        guarantees as this can reduce performance by two to three orders of magnitude. Our protocol for allowing a replica to rejoin the ISR ensures that before rejoining, it must fully re-sync again even if it lost unflushed
        data in its crash.

    </p><h4><a id="design_uncleanleader" href="#design_uncleanleader">Unclean leader election: What if they all die?</a></h4>

        Note that Kafka's guarantee with respect to data loss is predicated on at least one replica remaining in sync. If all the nodes replicating a partition die, this guarantee no longer holds.
        <p>
            However a practical system needs to do something reasonable when all the replicas die. If you are unlucky enough to have this occur, it is important to consider what will happen. There are two behaviors that could be
            implemented:
        </p><ol>
        <li>Wait for a replica in the ISR to come back to life and choose this replica as the leader (hopefully it still has all its data).
        </li><li>Choose the first replica (not necessarily in the ISR) that comes back to life as the leader.
    </li></ol>
        <p>
            This is a simple tradeoff between availability and consistency. If we wait for replicas in the ISR, then we will remain unavailable as long as those replicas are down. If such replicas were destroyed or their data
            was lost, then we are permanently down. If, on the other hand, a non-in-sync replica comes back to life and we allow it to become leader, then its log becomes the source of truth even though it is not guaranteed to
            have every committed message. By default from version 0.11.0.0, Kafka chooses the first strategy and favor waiting for a consistent replica. This behavior can be changed using
            configuration property unclean.leader.election.enable, to support use cases where uptime is preferable to consistency.
        </p><p>
        This dilemma is not specific to Kafka. It exists in any quorum-based scheme. For example in a majority voting scheme, if a majority of servers suffer a permanent failure, then you must either choose to lose 100% of
        your data or violate consistency by taking what remains on an existing server as your new source of truth.


    </p><h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="design_ha" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#design_ha">Availability and Durability Guarantees</a></h4>

        When writing to Kafka, producers can choose whether they wait for the message to be acknowledged by 0,1 or all (-1) replicas.
        Note that "acknowledgement by all replicas" does not guarantee that the full set of assigned replicas have received the message. By default, when acks=all, acknowledgement happens as soon as all the current in-sync
        replicas have received the message. For example, if a topic is configured with only two replicas and one fails (i.e., only one in sync replica remains), then writes that specify acks=all will succeed. However, these
        writes could be lost if the remaining replica also fails.

        Although this ensures maximum availability of the partition, this behavior may be undesirable to some users who prefer durability over availability. Therefore, we provide two topic-level configurations that can be
        used to prefer message durability over availability:
        <ol>
            <li> Disable unclean leader election - if all replicas become unavailable, then the partition will remain unavailable until the most recent leader becomes available again. This effectively prefers unavailability
                over the risk of message loss. See the previous section on Unclean Leader Election for clarification. </li>
            <li> Specify a minimum ISR size - the partition will only accept writes if the size of the ISR is above a certain minimum, in order to prevent the loss of messages that were written to just a single replica,
                which subsequently becomes unavailable. This setting only takes effect if the producer uses acks=all and guarantees that the message will be acknowledged by at least this many in-sync replicas.
                This setting offers a trade-off between consistency and availability. A higher setting for minimum ISR size guarantees better consistency since the message is guaranteed to be written to more replicas which reduces
                the probability that it will be lost. However, it reduces availability since the partition will be unavailable for writes if the number of in-sync replicas drops below the minimum threshold. </li>
        </ol>


        <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="design_replicamanagment" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#design_replicamanagment">Replica Management</a></h4>

        The above discussion on replicated logs really covers only a single log, i.e. one topic partition. However a Kafka cluster will manage hundreds or thousands of these partitions. We attempt to balance partitions
        within a cluster in a round-robin fashion to avoid clustering all partitions for high-volume topics on a small number of nodes. Likewise we try to balance leadership so that each node is the leader for a proportional
        share of its partitions.
        <p>
            It is also important to optimize the leadership election process as that is the critical window of unavailability. A naive implementation of leader election would end up running an election per partition for all
            partitions a node hosted when that node failed. As discussed above in the section on <a href="#replication">replication</a>, Kafka clusters have a special role known as the "controller" which is
            responsible for managing the registration of brokers. If the controller detects the failure of a broker, it is responsible for electing one of the remaining members of the ISR to serve as the new leader.
            The result is that we are able to batch together many of the required leadership change notifications which makes the election process far cheaper and faster for a large number
            of partitions. If the controller itself fails, then another controller will be elected.

        </p><h3 class="anchor-heading"><a id="compaction" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#compaction">4.8 Log Compaction</a></h3>

        Log compaction ensures that Kafka will always retain at least the last known value for each message key within the log of data for a single topic partition.  It addresses use cases and scenarios such as restoring
        state after application crashes or system failure, or reloading caches after application restarts during operational maintenance. Let's dive into these use cases in more detail and then describe how compaction works.
        <p>
            So far we have described only the simpler approach to data retention where old log data is discarded after a fixed period of time or when the log reaches some predetermined size. This works well for temporal event
            data such as logging where each record stands alone. However an important class of data streams are the log of changes to keyed, mutable data (for example, the changes to a database table).
        </p><p>
        Let's discuss a concrete example of such a stream. Say we have a topic containing user email addresses; every time a user updates their email address we send a message to this topic using their user id as the
        primary key. Now say we send the following messages over some time period for a user with id 123, each message corresponding to a change in email address (messages for other ids are omitted):
    </p><pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">123 =&gt; bill@microsoft.com
        .
        .
        .
123 =&gt; bill@gatesfoundation.org
        .
        .
        .
123 =&gt; bill@gmail.com<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>
        Log compaction gives us a more granular retention mechanism so that we are guaranteed to retain at least the last update for each primary key (e.g. <code>bill@gmail.com</code>). By doing this we guarantee that the
        log contains a full snapshot of the final value for every key not just keys that changed recently. This means downstream consumers can restore their own state off this topic without us having to retain a complete
        log of all changes.
        <p>
            Let's start by looking at a few use cases where this is useful, then we'll see how it can be used.
        </p><ol>
        <li><i>Database change subscription</i>. It is often necessary to have a data set in multiple data systems, and often one of these systems is a database of some kind (either a RDBMS or perhaps a new-fangled key-value
            store). For example you might have a database, a cache, a search cluster, and a Hadoop cluster. Each change to the database will need to be reflected in the cache, the search cluster, and eventually in Hadoop.
            In the case that one is only handling the real-time updates you only need recent log. But if you want to be able to reload the cache or restore a failed search node you may need a complete data set.
        </li><li><i>Event sourcing</i>. This is a style of application design which co-locates query processing with application design and uses a log of changes as the primary store for the application.
    </li><li><i>Journaling for high-availability</i>. A process that does local computation can be made fault-tolerant by logging out changes that it makes to its local state so another process can reload these changes and
        carry on if it should fail. A concrete example of this is handling counts, aggregations, and other "group by"-like processing in a stream query system. Samza, a real-time stream-processing framework,
        <a href="http://samza.apache.org/learn/documentation/0.7.0/container/state-management.html">uses this feature</a> for exactly this purpose.
    </li></ol>
        In each of these cases one needs primarily to handle the real-time feed of changes, but occasionally, when a machine crashes or data needs to be re-loaded or re-processed, one needs to do a full load.
        Log compaction allows feeding both of these use cases off the same backing topic.

        This style of usage of a log is described in more detail in <a href="http://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying">this blog post</a>.
        <p>
            The general idea is quite simple. If we had infinite log retention, and we logged each change in the above cases, then we would have captured the state of the system at each time from when it first began.
            Using this complete log, we could restore to any point in time by replaying the first N records in the log. This hypothetical complete log is not very practical for systems that update a single record many times
            as the log will grow without bound even for a stable dataset. The simple log retention mechanism which throws away old updates will bound space but the log is no longer a way to restore the current state—now
            restoring from the beginning of the log no longer recreates the current state as old updates may not be captured at all.
        </p><p>
        Log compaction is a mechanism to give finer-grained per-record retention, rather than the coarser-grained time-based retention. The idea is to selectively remove records where we have a more recent update with the
        same primary key. This way the log is guaranteed to have at least the last state for each key.
    </p><p>
        This retention policy can be set per-topic, so a single cluster can have some topics where retention is enforced by size or time and other topics where retention is enforced by compaction.
    </p><p>
        This functionality is inspired by one of LinkedIn's oldest and most successful pieces of infrastructure—a database changelog caching service called <a href="https://github.com/linkedin/databus">Databus</a>.
        Unlike most log-structured storage systems Kafka is built for subscription and organizes data for fast linear reads and writes. Unlike Databus, Kafka acts as a source-of-truth store so it is useful even in
        situations where the upstream data source would not otherwise be replayable.

    </p><h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="design_compactionbasics" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#design_compactionbasics">Log Compaction Basics</a></h4>

        Here is a high-level picture that shows the logical structure of a Kafka log with the offset for each message.
        <p>
            ......
        </p><p>
        The head of the log is identical to a traditional Kafka log. It has dense, sequential offsets and retains all messages. Log compaction adds an option for handling the tail of the log. The picture above shows a log
        with a compacted tail. Note that the messages in the tail of the log retain the original offset assigned when they were first written—that never changes. Note also that all offsets remain valid positions in
        the log, even if the message with that offset has been compacted away; in this case this position is indistinguishable from the next highest offset that does appear in the log. For example, in the picture above the
        offsets 36, 37, and 38 are all equivalent positions and a read beginning at any of these offsets would return a message set beginning with 38.
    </p><p>
        Compaction also allows for deletes. A message with a key and a null payload will be treated as a delete from the log. Such a record is sometimes referred to as a <i>tombstone</i>. This delete marker will cause any prior message with that key to be removed (as would any new
        message with that key), but delete markers are special in that they will themselves be cleaned out of the log after a period of time to free up space. The point in time at which deletes are no longer retained is
        marked as the "delete retention point" in the above diagram.
    </p><p>
        The compaction is done in the background by periodically recopying log segments. Cleaning does not block reads and can be throttled to use no more than a configurable amount of I/O throughput to avoid impacting
        producers and consumers. The actual process of compacting a log segment looks something like this:

        <a href="#design_compactionguarantees">What guarantees does log compaction provide</a>?
    </h4>

        Log compaction guarantees the following:
        <ol>
            <li>Any consumer that stays caught-up to within the head of the log will see every message that is written; these messages will have sequential offsets. The topic's <code>min.compaction.lag.ms</code> can be used to
                guarantee the minimum length of time must pass after a message is written before it could be compacted. I.e. it provides a lower bound on how long each message will remain in the (uncompacted) head.
                The topic's <code>max.compaction.lag.ms</code> can be used to guarantee the maximum delay between the time a message is written and the time the message becomes eligible for compaction.
            </li><li>Ordering of messages is always maintained.  Compaction will never re-order messages, just remove some.
        </li><li>The offset for a message never changes.  It is the permanent identifier for a position in the log.
        </li><li>Any consumer progressing from the start of the log will see at least the final state of all records in the order they were written.  Additionally, all delete markers for deleted records will be seen, provided
            the consumer reaches the head of the log in a time period less than the topic's <code>delete.retention.ms</code> setting (the default is 24 hours).  In other words: since the removal of delete markers happens
            concurrently with reads, it is possible for a consumer to miss delete markers if it lags by more than <code>delete.retention.ms</code>.
        </li></ol>

        <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="design_compactiondetails" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#design_compactiondetails">Log Compaction Details</a></h4>

        Log compaction is handled by the log cleaner, a pool of background threads that recopy log segment files, removing records whose key appears in the head of the log. Each compactor thread works as follows:
        <ol>
            <li>It chooses the log that has the highest ratio of log head to log tail
            </li><li>It creates a succinct summary of the last offset for each key in the head of the log
        </li><li>It recopies the log from beginning to end removing keys which have a later occurrence in the log. New, clean segments are swapped into the log immediately so the additional disk space required is just one
            additional log segment (not a fully copy of the log).
        </li><li>The summary of the log head is essentially just a space-compact hash table. It uses exactly 24 bytes per entry. As a result with 8GB of cleaner buffer one cleaner iteration can clean around 366GB of log head
            (assuming 1k messages).
        </li></ol>

        </p><h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="design_compactionconfig" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#design_compactionconfig">Configuring The Log Cleaner</a></h4>

        The log cleaner is enabled by default. This will start the pool of cleaner threads.
        To enable log cleaning on a particular topic, add the log-specific property
        <pre class="language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">log.cleanup.policy=compact</code></pre>

        The <code>log.cleanup.policy</code> property is a broker configuration setting defined
        in the broker's <code>server.properties</code> file; it affects all of the topics
        in the cluster that do not have a configuration override in place as documented
        <a href="/documentation.html#brokerconfigs">here</a>.

        The log cleaner can be configured to retain a minimum amount of the uncompacted "head" of the log. This is enabled by setting the compaction time lag.
        <pre class="language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">log.cleaner.min.compaction.lag.ms</code></pre>

        This can be used to prevent messages newer than a minimum message age from being subject to compaction. If not set, all log segments are eligible for compaction except for the last segment, i.e. the one currently
        being written to. The active segment will not be compacted even if all of its messages are older than the minimum compaction time lag.

        The log cleaner can be configured to ensure a maximum delay after which the uncompacted "head" of the log becomes eligible for log compaction.
        <pre class="language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">log.cleaner.max.compaction.lag.ms</code></pre>

        This can be used to prevent log with low produce rate from remaining ineligible for compaction for an unbounded duration. If not set, logs that do not exceed min.cleanable.dirty.ratio are not compacted.
        Note that this compaction deadline is not a hard guarantee since it is still subjected to the availability of log cleaner threads and the actual compaction time.
        You will want to monitor the uncleanable-partitions-count, max-clean-time-secs and max-compaction-delay-secs metrics.

        <p>
            Kafka cluster has the ability to enforce quotas on requests to control the broker resources used by clients. Two types
            of client quotas can be enforced by Kafka brokers for each group of clients sharing a quota:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Network bandwidth quotas define byte-rate thresholds (since 0.9)</li>
            <li>Request rate quotas define CPU utilization thresholds as a percentage of network and I/O threads (since 0.11)</li>
        </ol>

        <h4 class="anchor-heading">
            <a class="anchor-link" id="design_quotasnecessary" href="#design_quotasnecessary"></a>
            <a href="#design_quotasnecessary">Why are quotas necessary</a>?
        </h4>
        <p>
            It is possible for producers and consumers to produce/consume very high volumes of data or generate requests at a very high
            rate and thus monopolize broker resources, cause network saturation and generally DOS other clients and the brokers themselves.
            Having quotas protects against these issues and is all the more important in large multi-tenant clusters where a small set of badly behaved clients can degrade user experience for the well behaved ones.
            In fact, when running Kafka as a service this even makes it possible to enforce API limits according to an agreed upon contract.
        </p>
        <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="design_quotasgroups" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#design_quotasgroups">Client groups</a></h4>
        The identity of Kafka clients is the user principal which represents an authenticated user in a secure cluster. In a cluster that supports unauthenticated clients, user principal is a grouping of unauthenticated
        users
        chosen by the broker using a configurable <code>PrincipalBuilder</code>. Client-id is a logical grouping of clients with a meaningful name chosen by the client application. The tuple (user, client-id) defines
        a secure logical group of clients that share both user principal and client-id.
        <p>
            Quotas can be applied to (user, client-id), user or client-id groups. For a given connection, the most specific quota matching the connection is applied. All connections of a quota group share the quota configured for the group.
            For example, if (user="test-user", client-id="test-client") has a produce quota of 10MB/sec, this is shared across all producer instances of user "test-user" with the client-id "test-client".
        </p>
        <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="design_quotasconfig" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#design_quotasconfig">Quota Configuration</a></h4>
        <p>
            Quota configuration may be defined for (user, client-id), user and client-id groups. It is possible to override the default quota at any of the quota levels that needs a higher (or even lower) quota.
            The mechanism is similar to the per-topic log config overrides.
            User and (user, client-id) quota overrides are written to ZooKeeper under <i><b>/config/users</b></i> and client-id quota overrides are written under <i><b>/config/clients</b></i>.
            These overrides are read by all brokers and are effective immediately. This lets us change quotas without having to do a rolling restart of the entire cluster. See <a href="#quotas">here</a> for details.
            Default quotas for each group may also be updated dynamically using the same mechanism.
        </p>
        <p>
            The order of precedence for quota configuration is:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>/config/users/&lt;user&gt;/clients/&lt;client-id&gt;</li>
            <li>/config/users/&lt;user&gt;/clients/&lt;default&gt;</li>
            <li>/config/users/&lt;user&gt;</li>
            <li>/config/users/&lt;default&gt;/clients/&lt;client-id&gt;</li>
            <li>/config/users/&lt;default&gt;/clients/&lt;default&gt;</li>
            <li>/config/users/&lt;default&gt;</li>
            <li>/config/clients/&lt;client-id&gt;</li>
            <li>/config/clients/&lt;default&gt;</li>
        </ol>
        <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="design_quotasbandwidth" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#design_quotasbandwidth">Network Bandwidth Quotas</a></h4>
        <p>
            Network bandwidth quotas are defined as the byte rate threshold for each group of clients sharing a quota.
            By default, each unique client group receives a fixed quota in bytes/sec as configured by the cluster.
            This quota is defined on a per-broker basis. Each group of clients can publish/fetch a maximum of X bytes/sec
            per broker before clients are throttled.
        </p>
        <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="design_quotascpu" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#design_quotascpu">Request Rate Quotas</a></h4>
        <p>
            Request rate quotas are defined as the percentage of time a client can utilize on request handler I/O
            threads and network threads of each broker within a quota window. A quota of <tt>n%</tt> represents
            <tt>n%</tt> of one thread, so the quota is out of a total capacity of <tt>((num.io.threads + num.network.threads) * 100)%</tt>.
            Each group of clients may use a total percentage of upto <tt>n%</tt> across all I/O and network threads in a quota
            window before being throttled. Since the number of threads allocated for I/O and network threads are typically based
            on the number of cores available on the broker host, request rate quotas represent the total percentage of CPU
            that may be used by each group of clients sharing the quota.
        </p>
        <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="design_quotasenforcement" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#design_quotasenforcement">Enforcement</a></h4>
        <p>
            By default, each unique client group receives a fixed quota as configured by the cluster.
            This quota is defined on a per-broker basis. Each client can utilize this quota per broker before it gets throttled. We decided that defining these quotas per broker is much better than
            having a fixed cluster wide bandwidth per client because that would require a mechanism to share client quota usage among all the brokers. This can be harder to get right than the quota implementation itself!
        </p>
        <p>
            How does a broker react when it detects a quota violation? In our solution, the broker first computes the amount of delay needed to bring the violating client under its quota
            and returns a response with the delay immediately. In case of a fetch request, the response will not contain any data. Then, the broker mutes the channel to the client,
            not to process requests from the client anymore, until the delay is over. Upon receiving a response with a non-zero delay duration, the Kafka client will also refrain from
            sending further requests to the broker during the delay. Therefore, requests from a throttled client are effectively blocked from both sides.
            Even with older client implementations that do not respect the delay response from the broker, the back pressure applied by the broker via muting its socket channel
            can still handle the throttling of badly behaving clients. Those clients who sent further requests to the throttled channel will receive responses only after the delay is over.
        </p>
        <p>
            Byte-rate and thread utilization are measured over multiple small windows (e.g. 30 windows of 1 second each) in order to detect and correct quota violations quickly. Typically, having large measurement windows
            (for e.g. 10 windows of 30 seconds each) leads to large bursts of traffic followed by long delays which is not great in terms of user experience.

        <p>
            The network layer is a fairly straight-forward NIO server, and will not be described in great detail. The sendfile implementation is done by giving the <code>TransferableRecords</code> interface a <code>writeTo</code> method. This allows the file-backed message set to use the more efficient <code>transferTo</code> implementation instead of an in-process buffered write. The threading model is a single acceptor thread and <i>N</i> processor threads which handle a fixed number of connections each. This design has been pretty thoroughly tested <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120619234320/http://sna-projects.com/blog/2009/08/introducing-the-nio-socketserver-implementation/">elsewhere</a> and found to be simple to implement and fast.

            Messages consist of a variable-length header, a variable-length opaque key byte array and a variable-length opaque value byte array. The format of the header is described in the following section.
            Leaving the key and value opaque is the right decision: there is a great deal of progress being made on serialization libraries right now, and any particular choice is unlikely to be right for all uses. Needless to say a particular application using Kafka would likely mandate a particular serialization type as part of its usage. The <code>RecordBatch</code> interface is simply an iterator over messages with specialized methods for bulk reading and writing to an NIO <code>Channel</code>.</p>

        <p> Note that when compression is enabled, the compressed record data is serialized directly following the count of the number of records. </p>

        <p>The CRC covers the data from the attributes to the end of the batch (i.e. all the bytes that follow the CRC). It is located after the magic byte, which
            means that clients must parse the magic byte before deciding how to interpret the bytes between the batch length and the magic byte. The partition leader
            epoch field is not included in the CRC computation to avoid the need to recompute the CRC when this field is assigned for every batch that is received by
            the broker. The CRC-32C (Castagnoli) polynomial is used for the computation.</p>

        <p>On compaction: unlike the older message formats, magic v2 and above preserves the first and last offset/sequence numbers from the original batch when the log is cleaned. This is required in order to be able to restore the
            producer's state when the log is reloaded. If we did not retain the last sequence number, for example, then after a partition leader failure, the producer might see an OutOfSequence error. The base sequence number must
            be preserved for duplicate checking (the broker checks incoming Produce requests for duplicates by verifying that the first and last sequence numbers of the incoming batch match the last from that producer). As a result,
            it is possible to have empty batches in the log when all the records in the batch are cleaned but batch is still retained in order to preserve a producer's last sequence number. One oddity here is that the baseTimestamp
            field is not preserved during compaction, so it will change if the first record in the batch is compacted away.</p>

        <p>Compaction may also modify the baseTimestamp if the record batch contains records with a null payload or aborted transaction markers. The baseTimestamp will be set to the timestamp of when those records should be deleted
            with the delete horizon attribute bit also set.</p>

            Prior to Kafka 0.11, messages were transferred and stored in <i>message sets</i>. In a message set, each message has its own metadata. Note that although message sets are represented as an array,
            they are not preceded by an int32 array size like other array elements in the protocol.

        <p>
            In versions prior to Kafka 0.10, the only supported message format version (which is indicated in the magic value) was 0. Message format version 1 was introduced with timestamp support in version 0.10.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Similarly to version 2 above, the lowest bits of attributes represent the compression type.</li>
            <li>In version 1, the producer should always set the timestamp type bit to 0. If the topic is configured to use log append time,
                (through either broker level config log.message.timestamp.type = LogAppendTime or topic level config message.timestamp.type = LogAppendTime),
                the broker will overwrite the timestamp type and the timestamp in the message set.</li>
            <li>The highest bits of attributes must be set to 0.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In message format versions 0 and 1 Kafka supports recursive messages to enable compression. In this case the message's attributes must be set
            to indicate one of the compression types and the value field will contain a message set compressed with that type. We often refer
            to the nested messages as "inner messages" and the wrapping message as the "outer message." Note that the key should be null
            for the outer message and its offset will be the offset of the last inner message.
        </p>
        <p>When receiving recursive version 0 messages, the broker decompresses them and each inner message is assigned an offset individually.
            In version 1, to avoid server side re-compression, only the wrapper message will be assigned an offset. The inner messages
            will have relative offsets. The absolute offset can be computed using the offset from the outer message, which corresponds
            to the offset assigned to the last inner message.
        </p>

        <p>The crc field contains the CRC32 (and not CRC-32C) of the subsequent message bytes (i.e. from magic byte to the value).</p>

        <h3 class="anchor-heading"><a id="log" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#log">5.4 Log</a></h3>
        <p>
            A log for a topic named "my-topic" with two partitions consists of two directories (namely <code>my-topic-0</code> and <code>my-topic-1</code>) populated with data files containing the messages for that topic. The format of the log files is a sequence of "log entries"; each log entry is a 4 byte integer <i>N</i> storing the message length which is followed by the <i>N</i> message bytes. Each message is uniquely identified by a 64-bit integer <i>offset</i> giving the byte position of the start of this message in the stream of all messages ever sent to that topic on that partition. The on-disk format of each message is given below. Each log file is named with the offset of the first message it contains. So the first file created will be 00000000000000000000.log, and each additional file will have an integer name roughly <i>S</i> bytes from the previous file where <i>S</i> is the max log file size given in the configuration.
        </p>
        <p>
            The exact binary format for records is versioned and maintained as a standard interface so record batches can be transferred between producer, broker, and client without recopying or conversion when desirable. The previous section included details about the on-disk format of records.
        </p>
        <p>
            The use of the message offset as the message id is unusual. Our original idea was to use a GUID generated by the producer, and maintain a mapping from GUID to offset on each broker. But since a consumer must maintain an ID for each server, the global uniqueness of the GUID provides no value. Furthermore, the complexity of maintaining the mapping from a random id to an offset requires a heavy weight index structure which must be synchronized with disk, essentially requiring a full persistent random-access data structure. Thus to simplify the lookup structure we decided to use a simple per-partition atomic counter which could be coupled with the partition id and node id to uniquely identify a message; this makes the lookup structure simpler, though multiple seeks per consumer request are still likely. However once we settled on a counter, the jump to directly using the offset seemed natural—both after all are monotonically increasing integers unique to a partition. Since the offset is hidden from the consumer API this decision is ultimately an implementation detail and we went with the more efficient approach.
        </p>

        <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="impl_writes" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#impl_writes">Writes</a></h4>
        <p>
            The log allows serial appends which always go to the last file. This file is rolled over to a fresh file when it reaches a configurable size (say 1GB). The log takes two configuration parameters: <i>M</i>, which gives the number of messages to write before forcing the OS to flush the file to disk, and <i>S</i>, which gives a number of seconds after which a flush is forced. This gives a durability guarantee of losing at most <i>M</i> messages or <i>S</i> seconds of data in the event of a system crash.
        </p>
        <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="impl_reads" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#impl_reads">Reads</a></h4>
        <p>
            Reads are done by giving the 64-bit logical offset of a message and an <i>S</i>-byte max chunk size. This will return an iterator over the messages contained in the <i>S</i>-byte buffer. <i>S</i> is intended to be larger than any single message, but in the event of an abnormally large message, the read can be retried multiple times, each time doubling the buffer size, until the message is read successfully. A maximum message and buffer size can be specified to make the server reject messages larger than some size, and to give a bound to the client on the maximum it needs to ever read to get a complete message. It is likely that the read buffer ends with a partial message, this is easily detected by the size delimiting.
        </p>
        <p>
            The actual process of reading from an offset requires first locating the log segment file in which the data is stored, calculating the file-specific offset from the global offset value, and then reading from that file offset. The search is done as a simple binary search variation against an in-memory range maintained for each file.
        </p>
        <p>
            The log provides the capability of getting the most recently written message to allow clients to start subscribing as of "right now". This is also useful in the case the consumer fails to consume its data within its SLA-specified number of days. In this case when the client attempts to consume a non-existent offset it is given an OutOfRangeException and can either reset itself or fail as appropriate to the use case.
        </p>

        <p>
            Data is deleted one log segment at a time. The log manager applies two metrics to identify segments which are
            eligible for deletion: time and size. For time-based policies, the record timestamps are considered, with the
            largest timestamp in a segment file (order of records is not relevant) defining the retention time for the
            entire segment. Size-based retention is disabled by default. When enabled the log manager keeps deleting the
            oldest segment file until the overall size of the partition is within the configured limit again. If both
            policies are enabled at the same time, a segment that is eligible for deletion due to either policy will be
            deleted. To avoid locking reads while still allowing deletes that modify the segment list we use a copy-on-write
            style segment list implementation that provides consistent views to allow a binary search to proceed on an
            immutable static snapshot view of the log segments while deletes are progressing.
        </p>
        <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="impl_guarantees" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#impl_guarantees">Guarantees</a></h4>
        <p>
            The log provides a configuration parameter <i>M</i> which controls the maximum number of messages that are written before forcing a flush to disk. On startup a log recovery process is run that iterates over all messages in the newest log segment and verifies that each message entry is valid. A message entry is valid if the sum of its size and offset are less than the length of the file AND the CRC32 of the message payload matches the CRC stored with the message. In the event corruption is detected the log is truncated to the last valid offset.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that two kinds of corruption must be handled: truncation in which an unwritten block is lost due to a crash, and corruption in which a nonsense block is ADDED to the file. The reason for this is that in general the OS makes no guarantee of the write order between the file inode and the actual block data so in addition to losing written data the file can gain nonsense data if the inode is updated with a new size but a crash occurs before the block containing that data is written. The CRC detects this corner case, and prevents it from corrupting the log (though the unwritten messages are, of course, lost).
        </p>

        <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="impl_offsettracking" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#impl_offsettracking">Consumer Offset Tracking</a></h4>
        <p>
            Kafka consumer tracks the maximum offset it has consumed in each partition and has the capability to commit offsets so
            that it can resume from those offsets in the event of a restart. Kafka provides the option to store all the offsets for
            a given consumer group in a designated broker (for that group) called the group coordinator.  i.e., any consumer instance
            in that consumer group should send its offset commits and fetches to that group coordinator (broker). Consumer groups are
            assigned to coordinators based on their group names. A consumer can look up its coordinator by issuing a FindCoordinatorRequest
            to any Kafka broker and reading the FindCoordinatorResponse which will contain the coordinator details. The consumer
            can then proceed to commit or fetch offsets from the coordinator broker. In case the coordinator moves, the consumer will
            need to rediscover the coordinator. Offset commits can be done automatically or manually by consumer instance.
        </p>

        <p>
            When the group coordinator receives an OffsetCommitRequest, it appends the request to a special <a href="#compaction">compacted</a> Kafka topic named <i>__consumer_offsets</i>.
            The broker sends a successful offset commit response to the consumer only after all the replicas of the offsets topic receive the offsets.
            In case the offsets fail to replicate within a configurable timeout, the offset commit will fail and the consumer may retry the commit after backing off.
            The brokers periodically compact the offsets topic since it only needs to maintain the most recent offset commit per partition.
            The coordinator also caches the offsets in an in-memory table in order to serve offset fetches quickly.
        </p>

        <p>
            When the coordinator receives an offset fetch request, it simply returns the last committed offset vector from the offsets cache.
            In case coordinator was just started or if it just became the coordinator for a new set of consumer groups (by becoming a leader for a partition of the offsets topic),
            it may need to load the offsets topic partition into the cache. In this case, the offset fetch will fail with an
            CoordinatorLoadInProgressException and the consumer may retry the OffsetFetchRequest after backing off.

            When an element in a path is denoted <code>[xyz]</code>, that means that the value of xyz is not fixed and there is in fact a ZooKeeper znode for each possible value of xyz. For example <code>/topics/[topic]</code> would be a directory named /topics containing a sub-directory for each topic name. Numerical ranges are also given such as <code>[0...5]</code> to indicate the subdirectories 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. An arrow <code>-&gt;</code> is used to indicate the contents of a znode. For example <code>/hello -&gt; world</code> would indicate a znode /hello containing the value "world".

        <p>
            This is a list of all present broker nodes, each of which provides a unique logical broker id which identifies it to consumers (which must be given as part of its configuration). On startup, a broker node registers itself by creating a znode with the logical broker id under /brokers/ids. The purpose of the logical broker id is to allow a broker to be moved to a different physical machine without affecting consumers. An attempt to register a broker id that is already in use (say because two servers are configured with the same broker id) results in an error.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since the broker registers itself in ZooKeeper using ephemeral znodes, this registration is dynamic and will disappear if the broker is shutdown or dies (thus notifying consumers it is no longer available).

        <p>
            The cluster id is a unique and immutable identifier assigned to a Kafka cluster. The cluster id can have a maximum of 22 characters and the allowed characters are defined by the regular expression [a-zA-Z0-9_\-]+, which corresponds to the characters used by the URL-safe Base64 variant with no padding. Conceptually, it is auto-generated when a cluster is started for the first time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Implementation-wise, it is generated when a broker with version 0.10.1 or later is successfully started for the first time. The broker tries to get the cluster id from the <code>/cluster/id</code> znode during startup. If the znode does not exist, the broker generates a new cluster id and creates the znode with this cluster id.

        <p>
            The broker nodes are basically independent, so they only publish information about what they have. When a broker joins, it registers itself under the broker node registry directory and writes information about its host name and port. The broker also register the list of existing topics and their logical partitions in the broker topic registry. New topics are registered dynamically when they are created on the broker.

    Here is some information on actually running Kafka as a production system based on usage and experience at LinkedIn. Please send us any additional tips you know of.

    <h3 class="anchor-heading"><a id="basic_ops" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#basic_ops">6.1 Basic Kafka Operations</a></h3>

    This section will review the most common operations you will perform on your Kafka cluster. All of the tools reviewed in this section are available under the <code>bin/</code> directory of the Kafka distribution and each tool will print details on all possible commandline options if it is run with no arguments.

    <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="basic_ops_add_topic" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#basic_ops_add_topic">Adding and removing topics</a></h4>

    You have the option of either adding topics manually or having them be created automatically when data is first published to a non-existent topic. If topics are auto-created then you may want to tune the default <a href="#topicconfigs">topic configurations</a> used for auto-created topics.
    <p>
        Topics are added and modified using the topic tool:
    </p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash">  <span class="token operator">&gt;</span> bin/kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server broker_host:port --create --topic my_topic_name <span class="token punctuation">\</span>
        --partitions <span class="token number">20</span> --replication-factor <span class="token number">3</span> --config <span class="token assign-left variable">x</span><span class="token operator">=</span>y<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>
    The replication factor controls how many servers will replicate each message that is written. If you have a replication factor of 3 then up to 2 servers can fail before you will lose access to your data. We recommend you use a replication factor of 2 or 3 so that you can transparently bounce machines without interrupting data consumption.
    <p>
        The partition count controls how many logs the topic will be sharded into. There are several impacts of the partition count. First each partition must fit entirely on a single server. So if you have 20 partitions the full data set (and read and write load) will be handled by no more than 20 servers (not counting replicas). Finally the partition count impacts the maximum parallelism of your consumers. This is discussed in greater detail in the <a href="#intro_consumers">concepts section</a>.
    </p><p>
    Each sharded partition log is placed into its own folder under the Kafka log directory. The name of such folders consists of the topic name, appended by a dash (-) and the partition id. Since a typical folder name can not be over 255 characters long, there will be a limitation on the length of topic names. We assume the number of partitions will not ever be above 100,000. Therefore, topic names cannot be longer than 249 characters. This leaves just enough room in the folder name for a dash and a potentially 5 digit long partition id.
</p><p>
    The configurations added on the command line override the default settings the server has for things like the length of time data should be retained. The complete set of per-topic configurations is documented <a href="#topicconfigs">here</a>.

</p><h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="basic_ops_modify_topic" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#basic_ops_modify_topic">Modifying topics</a></h4>

    You can change the configuration or partitioning of a topic using the same topic tool.
    <p>
        To add partitions you can do
    </p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash">  <span class="token operator">&gt;</span> bin/kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server broker_host:port --alter --topic my_topic_name <span class="token punctuation">\</span>
        --partitions <span class="token number">40</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>
    Be aware that one use case for partitions is to semantically partition data, and adding partitions doesn't change the partitioning of existing data so this may disturb consumers if they rely on that partition. That is if data is partitioned by <code>hash(key) % number_of_partitions</code> then this partitioning will potentially be shuffled by adding partitions but Kafka will not attempt to automatically redistribute data in any way.
    <p>
        To add configs:
    </p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash">  <span class="token operator">&gt;</span> bin/kafka-configs.sh --bootstrap-server broker_host:port --entity-type topics --entity-name my_topic_name --alter --add-config <span class="token assign-left variable">x</span><span class="token operator">=</span>y<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>
    To remove a config:
    <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash">  <span class="token operator">&gt;</span> bin/kafka-configs.sh --bootstrap-server broker_host:port --entity-type topics --entity-name my_topic_name --alter --delete-config x<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>
    And finally deleting a topic:
    <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash">  <span class="token operator">&gt;</span> bin/kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server broker_host:port --delete --topic my_topic_name<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>
    <p>
        Kafka does not currently support reducing the number of partitions for a topic.
    </p><p>
    Instructions for changing the replication factor of a topic can be found <a href="#basic_ops_increase_replication_factor">here</a>.

</p><h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="basic_ops_restarting" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#basic_ops_restarting">Graceful shutdown</a></h4>

    The Kafka cluster will automatically detect any broker shutdown or failure and elect new leaders for the partitions on that machine. This will occur whether a server fails or it is brought down intentionally for maintenance or configuration changes. For the latter cases Kafka supports a more graceful mechanism for stopping a server than just killing it.

    When a server is stopped gracefully it has two optimizations it will take advantage of:
    <ol>
        <li>It will sync all its logs to disk to avoid needing to do any log recovery when it restarts (i.e. validating the checksum for all messages in the tail of the log). Log recovery takes time so this speeds up intentional restarts.
        </li><li>It will migrate any partitions the server is the leader for to other replicas prior to shutting down. This will make the leadership transfer faster and minimize the time each partition is unavailable to a few milliseconds.
    </li></ol>

    Syncing the logs will happen automatically whenever the server is stopped other than by a hard kill, but the controlled leadership migration requires using a special setting:
    <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">      controlled.shutdown.enable=true<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>
    Note that controlled shutdown will only succeed if <i>all</i> the partitions hosted on the broker have replicas (i.e. the replication factor is greater than 1 <i>and</i> at least one of these replicas is alive). This is generally what you want since shutting down the last replica would make that topic partition unavailable.

    <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="basic_ops_leader_balancing" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#basic_ops_leader_balancing">Balancing leadership</a></h4>

    Whenever a broker stops or crashes, leadership for that broker's partitions transfers to other replicas. When the broker is restarted it will only be a follower for all its partitions, meaning it will not be used for client reads and writes.
    <p>
        To avoid this imbalance, Kafka has a notion of preferred replicas. If the list of replicas for a partition is 1,5,9 then node 1 is preferred as the leader to either node 5 or 9 because it is earlier in the replica list. By default the Kafka cluster will try to restore leadership to the preferred replicas. This behaviour is configured with:

    </p><pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">      auto.leader.rebalance.enable=true<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>
    You can also set this to false, but you will then need to manually restore leadership to the restored replicas by running the command:
    <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash">  <span class="token operator">&gt;</span> bin/kafka-leader-election.sh --bootstrap-server broker_host:port --election-type preferred --all-topic-partitions<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>

    <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="basic_ops_racks" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#basic_ops_racks">Balancing Replicas Across Racks</a></h4>
    The rack awareness feature spreads replicas of the same partition across different racks. This extends the guarantees Kafka provides for broker-failure to cover rack-failure, limiting the risk of data loss should all the brokers on a rack fail at once. The feature can also be applied to other broker groupings such as availability zones in EC2.
    <p></p>
    You can specify that a broker belongs to a particular rack by adding a property to the broker config:
    <pre class="language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">  broker.rack=my-rack-id</code></pre>
    When a topic is <a href="#basic_ops_add_topic">created</a>, <a href="#basic_ops_modify_topic">modified</a> or replicas are <a href="#basic_ops_cluster_expansion">redistributed</a>, the rack constraint will be honoured, ensuring replicas span as many racks as they can (a partition will span min(#racks, replication-factor) different racks).
    <p></p>
    The algorithm used to assign replicas to brokers ensures that the number of leaders per broker will be constant, regardless of how brokers are distributed across racks. This ensures balanced throughput.
    <p></p>
    However if racks are assigned different numbers of brokers, the assignment of replicas will not be even. Racks with fewer brokers will get more replicas, meaning they will use more storage and put more resources into replication. Hence it is sensible to configure an equal number of brokers per rack.

        Kafka administrators can define data flows that cross the boundaries of individual Kafka clusters, data centers, or geographical regions. Please refer to the section on <a href="#georeplication">Geo-Replication</a> for further information.

    <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="basic_ops_consumer_lag" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#basic_ops_consumer_lag">Checking consumer position</a></h4>
    Sometimes it's useful to see the position of your consumers. We have a tool that will show the position of all consumers in a consumer group as well as how far behind the end of the log they are. To run this tool on a consumer group named <i>my-group</i> consuming a topic named <i>my-topic</i> would look like this:
    <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash">  <span class="token operator">&gt;</span> bin/kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --describe --group my-group

    <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="basic_ops_consumer_group" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#basic_ops_consumer_group">Managing Consumer Groups</a></h4>

    With the ConsumerGroupCommand tool, we can list, describe, or delete the consumer groups. The consumer group can be deleted manually, or automatically when the last committed offset for that group expires. Manual deletion works only if the group does not have any active members.

    For example, to list all consumer groups across all topics:

    <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash">  <span class="token operator">&gt;</span> bin/kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --list

  test-consumer-group<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>

    To view offsets, as mentioned earlier, we "describe" the consumer group like this:

    <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash">  <span class="token operator">&gt;</span> bin/kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --describe --group my-group

    There are a number of additional "describe" options that can be used to provide more detailed information about a consumer group:

        --by-duration &lt;String: duration&gt; : Reset offsets to offset by duration from current timestamp. Format: 'PnDTnHnMnS'
    </li>
    <li>
        --to-offset : Reset offsets to a specific offset.

</ul>

    Please note, that out of range offsets will be adjusted to available offset end. For example, if offset end is at 10 and offset shift request is
    of 15, then, offset at 10 will actually be selected.

    <p>
        For example, to reset offsets of a consumer group to the latest offset:

    </p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash">  <span class="token operator">&gt;</span> bin/kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --reset-offsets --group consumergroup1 --topic topic1 --to-latest

    <p>

        If you are using the old high-level consumer and storing the group metadata in ZooKeeper (i.e. <code>offsets.storage=zookeeper</code>), pass
        <code>--zookeeper</code> instead of <code>--bootstrap-server</code>:

    Adding servers to a Kafka cluster is easy, just assign them a unique broker id and start up Kafka on your new servers. However these new servers will not automatically be assigned any data partitions, so unless partitions are moved to them they won't be doing any work until new topics are created. So usually when you add machines to your cluster you will want to migrate some existing data to these machines.
    <p>
        The process of migrating data is manually initiated but fully automated. Under the covers what happens is that Kafka will add the new server as a follower of the partition it is migrating and allow it to fully replicate the existing data in that partition. When the new server has fully replicated the contents of this partition and joined the in-sync replica one of the existing replicas will delete their partition's data.
    </p><p>
    The partition reassignment tool can be used to move partitions across brokers. An ideal partition distribution would ensure even data load and partition sizes across all brokers. The partition reassignment tool does not have the capability to automatically study the data distribution in a Kafka cluster and move partitions around to attain an even load distribution. As such, the admin has to figure out which topics or partitions should be moved around.
</p><p>
    The partition reassignment tool can run in 3 mutually exclusive modes:
</p><ul>
    <li>--generate: In this mode, given a list of topics and a list of brokers, the tool generates a candidate reassignment to move all partitions of the specified topics to the new brokers. This option merely provides a convenient way to generate a partition reassignment plan given a list of topics and target brokers.</li>
    <li>--execute: In this mode, the tool kicks off the reassignment of partitions based on the user provided reassignment plan. (using the --reassignment-json-file option). This can either be a custom reassignment plan hand crafted by the admin or provided by using the --generate option</li>
    <li>--verify: In this mode, the tool verifies the status of the reassignment for all partitions listed during the last --execute. The status can be either of successfully completed, failed or in progress</li>
</ul>
    <h5 class="anchor-heading"><a id="basic_ops_automigrate" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#basic_ops_automigrate">Automatically migrating data to new machines</a></h5>
    The partition reassignment tool can be used to move some topics off of the current set of brokers to the newly added brokers. This is typically useful while expanding an existing cluster since it is easier to move entire topics to the new set of brokers, than moving one partition at a time. When used to do this, the user should provide a list of topics that should be moved to the new set of brokers and a target list of new brokers. The tool then evenly distributes all partitions for the given list of topics across the new set of brokers. During this move, the replication factor of the topic is kept constant. Effectively the replicas for all partitions for the input list of topics are moved from the old set of brokers to the newly added brokers.
    <p>
        For instance, the following example will move all partitions for topics foo1,foo2 to the new set of brokers 5,6. At the end of this move, all partitions for topics foo1 and foo2 will <i>only</i> exist on brokers 5,6.
    </p><p>
    Since the tool accepts the input list of topics as a json file, you first need to identify the topics you want to move and create the json file as follows:
</p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash">  <span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token function">cat</span> topics-to-move.json

        The tool generates a candidate assignment that will move all partitions from topics foo1,foo2 to brokers 5,6. Note, however, that at this point, the partition movement has not started, it merely tells you the current assignment and the proposed new assignment. The current assignment should be saved in case you want to rollback to it. The new assignment should be saved in a json file (e.g. expand-cluster-reassignment.json) to be input to the tool with the --execute option as follows:

    The partition reassignment tool can also be used to selectively move replicas of a partition to a specific set of brokers.

    The partition reassignment tool does not have the ability to automatically generate a reassignment plan for decommissioning brokers yet. As such, the admin has to come up with a reassignment plan to move the replica for all partitions hosted on the broker to be decommissioned, to the rest of the brokers. This can be relatively tedious as the reassignment needs to ensure that all the replicas are not moved from the decommissioned broker to only one other broker. To make this process effortless, we plan to add tooling support for decommissioning brokers in the future.

    Increasing the replication factor of an existing partition is easy. Just specify the extra replicas in the custom reassignment json file and use it with the --execute option to increase the replication factor of the specified partitions.
    <p>
        For instance, the following example increases the replication factor of partition 0 of topic foo from 1 to 3. Before increasing the replication factor, the partition's only replica existed on broker 5. As part of increasing the replication factor, we will add more replicas on brokers 6 and 7.

    Kafka lets you apply a throttle to replication traffic, setting an upper bound on the bandwidth used to move replicas from machine to machine. This is useful when rebalancing a cluster, bootstrapping a new broker or adding or removing brokers, as it limits the impact these data-intensive operations will have on users.
    <p></p>
    There are two interfaces that can be used to engage a throttle. The simplest, and safest, is to apply a throttle when invoking the kafka-reassign-partitions.sh, but kafka-configs.sh can also be used to view and alter the throttle values directly.

    So for example, if you were to execute a rebalance, with the below command, it would move partitions at no more than 50MB/s.
    <pre class="language-bash">$ bin/kafka-reassign-partitions.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --execute --reassignment-json-file bigger-cluster.json --throttle 50000000</pre>
    When you execute this script you will see the throttle engage:
    <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash">  The inter-broker throttle limit was <span class="token builtin class-name">set</span> to <span class="token number">50000000</span> B/s
  Successfully started partition reassignment <span class="token keyword">for</span> foo1-0<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>
    <p>Should you wish to alter the throttle, during a rebalance, say to increase the throughput so it completes quicker, you can do this by re-running the execute command with the --additional option passing the same reassignment-json-file:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash">$ bin/kafka-reassign-partitions.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092  --additional --execute --reassignment-json-file bigger-cluster.json --throttle 700000000
  The inter-broker throttle limit was set to 700000000 B/s</pre>

    <p>Once the rebalance completes the administrator can check the status of the rebalance using the --verify option.
        If the rebalance has completed, the throttle will be removed via the --verify command. It is important that
        administrators remove the throttle in a timely manner once rebalancing completes by running the command with
        the --verify option. Failure to do so could cause regular replication traffic to be throttled. </p>
    <p>When the --verify option is executed, and the reassignment has completed, the script will confirm that the throttle was removed:</p>

    <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash">  <span class="token operator">&gt;</span> bin/kafka-reassign-partitions.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092  --verify --reassignment-json-file bigger-cluster.json
  Status of partition reassignment:
  Reassignment of partition <span class="token punctuation">[</span>my-topic,1<span class="token punctuation">]</span> is completed
  Reassignment of partition <span class="token punctuation">[</span>my-topic,0<span class="token punctuation">]</span> is completed

  Clearing broker-level throttles on brokers <span class="token number">1,2</span>,3
  Clearing topic-level throttles on topic my-topic<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>

    <p>The administrator can also validate the assigned configs using the kafka-configs.sh. There are two pairs of throttle
        configuration used to manage the throttling process. First pair refers to the throttle value itself. This is configured, at a broker
        level, using the dynamic properties: </p>

    <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">    leader.replication.throttled.rate
    follower.replication.throttled.rate<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>

    <p>Then there is the configuration pair of enumerated sets of throttled replicas: </p>

    <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">    leader.replication.throttled.replicas
    follower.replication.throttled.replicas<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>

    <p>Which are configured per topic. </p>

    <p>All four config values are automatically assigned by kafka-reassign-partitions.sh (discussed below).</p>

    <p>To view the throttle limit configuration:</p>

    <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash">  <span class="token operator">&gt;</span> bin/kafka-configs.sh --describe --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --entity-type brokers
  Configs <span class="token keyword">for</span> brokers <span class="token string">'2'</span> are leader.replication.throttled.rate<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token number">700000000</span>,follower.replication.throttled.rate<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token number">700000000</span>
  Configs <span class="token keyword">for</span> brokers <span class="token string">'1'</span> are leader.replication.throttled.rate<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token number">700000000</span>,follower.replication.throttled.rate<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token number">700000000</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>

    <p>This shows the throttle applied to both leader and follower side of the replication protocol. By default both sides
        are assigned the same throttled throughput value. </p>

    <p>To view the list of throttled replicas:</p>

    <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash">  <span class="token operator">&gt;</span> bin/kafka-configs.sh --describe --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --entity-type topics
  Configs <span class="token keyword">for</span> topic <span class="token string">'my-topic'</span> are leader.replication.throttled.replicas<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token number">1</span>:102,0:101,
      follower.replication.throttled.replicas<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token number">1</span>:101,0:102<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>

    <p>Here we see the leader throttle is applied to partition 1 on broker 102 and partition 0 on broker 101. Likewise the
        follower throttle is applied to partition 1 on
        broker 101 and partition 0 on broker 102. </p>

    <p>By default kafka-reassign-partitions.sh will apply the leader throttle to all replicas that exist before the
        rebalance, any one of which might be leader.
        It will apply the follower throttle to all move destinations. So if there is a partition with replicas on brokers
        101,102, being reassigned to 102,103, a leader throttle,
        for that partition, would be applied to 101,102 and a follower throttle would be applied to 103 only. </p>


    <p>If required, you can also use the --alter switch on kafka-configs.sh to alter the throttle configurations manually.
    </p>

    <h5>Safe usage of throttled replication</h5>

    <p>Some care should be taken when using throttled replication. In particular:</p>

    <p><i>(1) Throttle Removal:</i></p>
    The throttle should be removed in a timely manner once reassignment completes (by running kafka-reassign-partitions.sh
    --verify).

    <p><i>(2) Ensuring Progress:</i></p>
    <p>If the throttle is set too low, in comparison to the incoming write rate, it is possible for replication to not
        make progress. This occurs when:</p>
    <pre>max(BytesInPerSec) &gt; throttle</pre>
    <p>
        Where BytesInPerSec is the metric that monitors the write throughput of producers into each broker. </p>
    <p>The administrator can monitor whether replication is making progress, during the rebalance, using the metric:</p>

    <pre>kafka.server:type=FetcherLagMetrics,name=ConsumerLag,clientId=([-.\w]+),topic=([-.\w]+),partition=([0-9]+)</pre>

    <p>The lag should constantly decrease during replication. If the metric does not decrease the administrator should
        increase the
        throttle throughput as described above. </p>

    <h3 class="anchor-heading"><a id="datacenters" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#datacenters">6.2 Datacenters</a></h3>

    Some deployments will need to manage a data pipeline that spans multiple datacenters. Our recommended approach to this is to deploy a local Kafka cluster in each datacenter, with application instances in each datacenter interacting only with their local cluster and mirroring data between clusters (see the documentation on <a href="#georeplication">Geo-Replication</a> for how to do this).
    <p>
        This deployment pattern allows datacenters to act as independent entities and allows us to manage and tune inter-datacenter replication centrally. This allows each facility to stand alone and operate even if the inter-datacenter links are unavailable: when this occurs the mirroring falls behind until the link is restored at which time it catches up.
    </p><p>
    For applications that need a global view of all data you can use mirroring to provide clusters which have aggregate data mirrored from the local clusters in <i>all</i> datacenters. These aggregate clusters are used for reads by applications that require the full data set.
</p><p>
    This is not the only possible deployment pattern. It is possible to read from or write to a remote Kafka cluster over the WAN, though obviously this will add whatever latency is required to get the cluster.
</p><p>
    Kafka naturally batches data in both the producer and consumer so it can achieve high-throughput even over a high-latency connection. To allow this though it may be necessary to increase the TCP socket buffer sizes for the producer, consumer, and broker using the <code>socket.send.buffer.bytes</code> and <code>socket.receive.buffer.bytes</code> configurations. The appropriate way to set this is documented <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth-delay_product">here</a>.
</p><p>
    It is generally <i>not</i> advisable to run a <i>single</i> Kafka cluster that spans multiple datacenters over a high-latency link. This will incur very high replication latency both for Kafka writes and ZooKeeper writes, and neither Kafka nor ZooKeeper will remain available in all locations if the network between locations is unavailable.

</p><h3 class="anchor-heading"><a id="georeplication" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#georeplication">6.3 Geo-Replication (Cross-Cluster Data Mirroring)</a></h3>

    <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="georeplication-overview" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#georeplication-overview">Geo-Replication Overview</a></h4>

    <p>
        Kafka administrators can define data flows that cross the boundaries of individual Kafka clusters, data centers, or geo-regions. Such event streaming setups are often needed for organizational, technical, or legal requirements. Common scenarios include:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Geo-replication</li>
        <li>Disaster recovery</li>
        <li>Feeding edge clusters into a central, aggregate cluster</li>
        <li>Physical isolation of clusters (such as production vs. testing)</li>
        <li>Cloud migration or hybrid cloud deployments</li>
        <li>Legal and compliance requirements</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Administrators can set up such inter-cluster data flows with Kafka's MirrorMaker (version 2), a tool to replicate data between different Kafka environments in a streaming manner. MirrorMaker is built on top of the Kafka Connect framework and supports features such as:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Replicates topics (data plus configurations)</li>
        <li>Replicates consumer groups including offsets to migrate applications between clusters</li>
        <li>Replicates ACLs</li>
        <li>Preserves partitioning</li>
        <li>Automatically detects new topics and partitions</li>
        <li>Provides a wide range of metrics, such as end-to-end replication latency across multiple data centers/clusters</li>
        <li>Fault-tolerant and horizontally scalable operations</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <em>Note: Geo-replication with MirrorMaker replicates data across Kafka clusters. This inter-cluster replication is different from Kafka's <a href="#replication">intra-cluster replication</a>, which replicates data within the same Kafka cluster.</em>
    </p>

    <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="georeplication-flows" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#georeplication-flows">What Are Replication Flows</a></h4>

    <p>
        With MirrorMaker, Kafka administrators can replicate topics, topic configurations, consumer groups and their offsets, and ACLs from one or more source Kafka clusters to one or more target Kafka clusters, i.e., across cluster environments. In a nutshell, MirrorMaker uses Connectors to consume from source clusters and produce to target clusters.
    </p>

    <p>
        These directional flows from source to target clusters are called replication flows. They are defined with the format <code>{source_cluster}-&gt;{target_cluster}</code> in the MirrorMaker configuration file as described later. Administrators can create complex replication topologies based on these flows.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here are some example patterns:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Active/Active high availability deployments: <code>A-&gt;B, B-&gt;A</code></li>
        <li>Active/Passive or Active/Standby high availability deployments: <code>A-&gt;B</code></li>
        <li>Aggregation (e.g., from many clusters to one): <code>A-&gt;K, B-&gt;K, C-&gt;K</code></li>
        <li>Fan-out (e.g., from one to many clusters): <code>K-&gt;A, K-&gt;B, K-&gt;C</code></li>
        <li>Forwarding: <code>A-&gt;B, B-&gt;C, C-&gt;D</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        By default, a flow replicates all topics and consumer groups (except excluded ones). However, each replication flow can be configured independently. For instance, you can define that only specific topics or consumer groups are replicated from the source cluster to the target cluster.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here is a first example on how to configure data replication from a <code>primary</code> cluster to a <code>secondary</code> cluster (an active/passive setup):
    </p>

    <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text"># Basic settings
clusters = primary, secondary
primary.bootstrap.servers = broker3-primary:9092

    <p>
        MirrorMaker is based on the Kafka Connect framework. Any Kafka Connect, source connector, and sink connector settings as described in the <a href="#connectconfigs">documentation chapter on Kafka Connect</a> can be used directly in the MirrorMaker configuration, without having to change or prefix the name of the configuration setting.
    </p>

    <p>
        Example: Define custom Kafka Connect settings to be used by MirrorMaker.
    </p>

    <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text"># Setting Kafka Connect defaults for MirrorMaker
tasks.max = 5
<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>

    <p>
        Most of the default Kafka Connect settings work well for MirrorMaker out-of-the-box, with the exception of <code>tasks.max</code>. In order to evenly distribute the workload across more than one MirrorMaker process, it is recommended to set <code>tasks.max</code> to at least <code>2</code> (preferably higher) depending on the available hardware resources and the total number of topic-partitions to be replicated.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can further customize MirrorMaker's Kafka Connect settings <em>per source or target cluster</em> (more precisely, you can specify Kafka Connect worker-level configuration settings "per connector"). Use the format of <code>{cluster}.{config_name}</code> in the MirrorMaker configuration file.
    </p>

    <p>
        Example: Define custom connector settings for the <code>us-west</code> cluster.
    </p>

    <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text"># us-west custom settings
us-west.offset.storage.topic = my-mirrormaker-offsets
<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>

    <p>
        MirrorMaker internally uses the Kafka producer, consumer, and admin clients. Custom settings for these clients are often needed. To override the defaults, use the following format in the MirrorMaker configuration file:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><code>{source}.consumer.{consumer_config_name}</code></li>
        <li><code>{target}.producer.{producer_config_name}</code></li>
        <li><code>{source_or_target}.admin.{admin_config_name}</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Example: Define custom producer, consumer, admin client settings.
    </p>

    <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text"># us-west cluster (from which to consume)

    <h5 class="anchor-heading"><a id="georeplication-exactly_once" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#georeplication-exactly_once">Exactly once</a></h5>

    <p>
        Exactly-once semantics are supported for dedicated MirrorMaker clusters as of version 3.5.0.</p>

    <p>
        For new MirrorMaker clusters, set the <code>exactly.once.source.support</code> property to enabled for all targeted Kafka clusters that should be written to with exactly-once semantics. For example, to enable exactly-once for writes to cluster us-east, the following configuration can be used:
    </p>

    <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">us-east.exactly.once.source.support = enabled
<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>

    <p>
        For existing MirrorMaker clusters, a two-step upgrade is necessary. Instead of immediately setting the <code>exactly.once.source.support</code> property to enabled, first set it to <code>preparing</code> on all nodes in the cluster. Once this is complete, it can be set to enabled on all nodes in the cluster, in a second round of restarts.
    </p>

    <p>
        In either case, it is also necessary to enable intra-cluster communication between the MirrorMaker nodes, as described in  <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-710%3A+Full+support+for+distributed+mode+in+dedicated+MirrorMaker+2.0+clusters">KIP-710</a>. To do this, the <code>dedicated.mode.enable.internal.rest</code> property must be set to <code>true</code>. In addition, many of the REST-related  <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connectconfigs">configuration properties available for Kafka Connect</a> can be specified the MirrorMaker config. For example, to enable intra-cluster communication in MirrorMaker cluster with each node listening on port 8080 of their local machine, the following should be added to the MirrorMaker config file:
    </p>

    <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">dedicated.mode.enable.internal.rest = true
listeners = http://localhost:8080
<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>

    <p><b>
        Note that, if intra-cluster communication is enabled in production environments, it is highly recommended to secure the REST servers brought up by each MirrorMaker node. See the <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connectconfigs">configuration properties for Kafka Connect</a> for information on how this can be accomplished.
    </b></p>

    <p>
        It is also recommended to filter records from aborted transactions out from replicated data when running MirrorMaker. To do this, ensure that the consumer used to read from source clusters is configured with <code>isolation.level</code> set to <code>read_committed</code>. If replicating data from cluster <code>us-west</code>, this can be done for all replication flows that read from that cluster by adding the following to the MirrorMaker config file:
    </p>

    <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">us-west.consumer.isolation.level = read_committed
<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>

    <p>
        As a final note, under the hood, MirrorMaker uses Kafka Connect source connectors to replicate data. For more information on exactly-once support for these kinds of connectors, see the <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connect_exactlyoncesource">relevant docs page</a>.
    </p>

    <h5 class="anchor-heading"><a id="georeplication-flow-create" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#georeplication-flow-create">Creating and Enabling Replication Flows</a></h5>

    <p>
        To define a replication flow, you must first define the respective source and target Kafka clusters in the MirrorMaker configuration file.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><code>clusters</code> (required): comma-separated list of Kafka cluster "aliases"</li>
        <li><code>{clusterAlias}.bootstrap.servers</code> (required): connection information for the specific cluster; comma-separated list of "bootstrap" Kafka brokers
        </li></ul>

    <p>
        Example: Define two cluster aliases <code>primary</code> and <code>secondary</code>, including their connection information.
    </p>

    <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">clusters = primary, secondary
primary.bootstrap.servers = broker10-primary:9092,broker-11-primary:9092
secondary.bootstrap.servers = broker5-secondary:9092,broker6-secondary:9092
<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>

    <p>
        Secondly, you must explicitly enable individual replication flows with <code>{source}-&gt;{target}.enabled = true</code> as needed. Remember that flows are directional: if you need two-way (bidirectional) replication, you must enable flows in both directions.
    </p>

    <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text"># Enable replication from primary to secondary
primary-&gt;secondary.enabled = true
<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>

    <p>
        By default, a replication flow will replicate all but a few special topics and consumer groups from the source cluster to the target cluster, and automatically detect any newly created topics and groups. The names of replicated topics in the target cluster will be prefixed with the name of the source cluster (see section further below). For example, the topic <code>foo</code> in the source cluster <code>us-west</code> would be replicated to a topic named <code>us-west.foo</code> in the target cluster <code>us-east</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The subsequent sections explain how to customize this basic setup according to your needs.
    </p>

    <h5 class="anchor-heading"><a id="georeplication-flow-configure" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#georeplication-flow-configure">Configuring Replication Flows</a></h5>

    <p>
        The configuration of a replication flow is a combination of top-level default settings (e.g., <code>topics</code>), on top of which flow-specific settings, if any, are applied (e.g., <code>us-west-&gt;us-east.topics</code>). To change the top-level defaults, add the respective top-level setting to the MirrorMaker configuration file. To override the defaults for a specific replication flow only, use the syntax format <code>{source}-&gt;{target}.{config.name}</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The most important settings are:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><code>topics</code>: list of topics or a regular expression that defines which topics in the source cluster to replicate (default: <code>topics = .*</code>)
        </li><li><code>topics.exclude</code>: list of topics or a regular expression to subsequently exclude topics that were matched by the <code>topics</code> setting (default: <code>topics.exclude = .*[\-\.]internal, .*\.replica, __.*</code>)
    </li><li><code>groups</code>: list of topics or regular expression that defines which consumer groups in the source cluster to replicate (default: <code>groups = .*</code>)
    </li><li><code>groups.exclude</code>: list of topics or a regular expression to subsequently exclude consumer groups that were matched by the <code>groups</code> setting (default: <code>groups.exclude = console-consumer-.*, connect-.*, __.*</code>)
    </li><li><code>{source}-&gt;{target}.enable</code>: set to <code>true</code> to enable the replication flow (default: <code>false</code>)
    </li></ul>

    <p>
        Example:
    </p>

    <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text"># Custom top-level defaults that apply to all replication flows
topics = .*
groups = consumer-group1, consumer-group2

# Don't forget to enable a flow!
us-west-&gt;us-east.enabled = true

# Custom settings for specific replication flows
us-west-&gt;us-east.topics = foo.*
us-west-&gt;us-east.groups = bar.*

    <h5 class="anchor-heading"><a id="georeplication-topic-naming" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#georeplication-topic-naming">Custom Naming of Replicated Topics in Target Clusters</a></h5>

    <p>
        Replicated topics in a target cluster—sometimes called <em>remote</em> topics—are renamed according to a replication policy. MirrorMaker uses this policy to ensure that events (aka records, messages) from different clusters are not written to the same topic-partition. By default as per <a href="https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/connect/mirror-client/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/mirror/DefaultReplicationPolicy.java">DefaultReplicationPolicy</a>, the names of replicated topics in the target clusters have the format <code>{source}.{source_topic_name}</code>:
    </p>

    <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">us-west         us-east
=========       =================
                bar-topic
foo-topic  --&gt;  us-west.foo-topic
<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>

    <p>
        You can customize the separator (default: <code>.</code>) with the <code>replication.policy.separator</code> setting:
    </p>

    <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text"># Defining a custom separator
us-west-&gt;us-east.replication.policy.separator = _
<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>

    <p>
        If you need further control over how replicated topics are named, you can implement a custom <code>ReplicationPolicy</code> and override <code>replication.policy.class</code> (default is <code>DefaultReplicationPolicy</code>) in the MirrorMaker configuration.
    </p>

    <h5 class="anchor-heading"><a id="georeplication-config-conflicts" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#georeplication-config-conflicts">Preventing Configuration Conflicts</a></h5>

    <p>
        MirrorMaker processes share configuration via their target Kafka clusters. This behavior may cause conflicts when configurations differ among MirrorMaker processes that operate against the same target cluster.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, the following two MirrorMaker processes would be racy:
    </p>

    <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text"># Configuration of process 1
A-&gt;B.enabled = true
A-&gt;B.topics = foo

# Configuration of process 2
A-&gt;B.enabled = true
A-&gt;B.topics = bar
<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>

    <p>
        In this case, the two processes will share configuration via cluster <code>B</code>, which causes a conflict. Depending on which of the two processes is the elected "leader", the result will be that either the topic <code>foo</code> or the topic <code>bar</code> is replicated, but not both.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is therefore important to keep the MirrorMaker configuration consistent across replication flows to the same target cluster. This can be achieved, for example, through automation tooling or by using a single, shared MirrorMaker configuration file for your entire organization.
    </p>

    <h5 class="anchor-heading"><a id="georeplication-best-practice" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#georeplication-best-practice">Best Practice: Consume from Remote, Produce to Local</a></h5>

    <p>
        To minimize latency ("producer lag"), it is recommended to locate MirrorMaker processes as close as possible to their target clusters, i.e., the clusters that it produces data to. That's because Kafka producers typically struggle more with unreliable or high-latency network connections than Kafka consumers.
    </p>

    <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">First DC          Second DC
==========        =========================

<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>

    <p>
        To run such a "consume from remote, produce to local" setup, run the MirrorMaker processes close to and preferably in the same location as the target clusters, and explicitly set these "local" clusters in the <code>--clusters</code> command line parameter (blank-separated list of cluster aliases):
    </p>

    <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text"># Run in secondary's data center, reading from the remote `primary` cluster
$ ./bin/connect-mirror-maker.sh connect-mirror-maker.properties --clusters secondary
<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>

    The <code>--clusters secondary</code> tells the MirrorMaker process that the given cluster(s) are nearby, and prevents it from replicating data or sending configuration to clusters at other, remote locations.

    <h5 class="anchor-heading"><a id="georeplication-example-multi-cluster" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#georeplication-example-multi-cluster">Example: Multi-Cluster Geo-Replication</a></h5>

    <p>
        Let's put all the information from the previous sections together in a larger example. Imagine there are three data centers (west, east, north), with two Kafka clusters in each data center (e.g., <code>west-1</code>, <code>west-2</code>). The example in this section shows how to configure MirrorMaker (1) for Active/Active replication within each data center, as well as (2) for Cross Data Center Replication (XDCR).
    </p>

    <p>
        First, define the source and target clusters along with their replication flows in the configuration:
    </p>

    <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text"># Basic settings
clusters: west-1, west-2, east-1, east-2, north-1, north-2

# Replication flows for Active/Active in West DC
west-1-&gt;west-2.enabled = true

    <p>
        Then, in each data center, launch one or more MirrorMaker as follows:
    </p>

    <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text"># In West DC:
$ ./bin/connect-mirror-maker.sh connect-mirror-maker.properties --clusters west-1 west-2

<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>

    <p>
        With this configuration, records produced to any cluster will be replicated within the data center, as well as across to other data centers. By providing the <code>--clusters</code> parameter, we ensure that each MirrorMaker process produces data to nearby clusters only.
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>Note:</em> The <code>--clusters</code> parameter is, technically, not required here. MirrorMaker will work fine without it. However, throughput may suffer from "producer lag" between data centers, and you may incur unnecessary data transfer costs.
    </p>

    <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="georeplication-starting" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#georeplication-starting">Starting Geo-Replication</a></h4>

    <p>
        You can run as few or as many MirrorMaker processes (think: nodes, servers) as needed. Because MirrorMaker is based on Kafka Connect, MirrorMaker processes that are configured to replicate the same Kafka clusters run in a distributed setup: They will find each other, share configuration (see section below), load balance their work, and so on. If, for example, you want to increase the throughput of replication flows, one option is to run additional MirrorMaker processes in parallel.
    </p>

    <p>
        To start a MirrorMaker process, run the command:
    </p>

    <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">$ ./bin/connect-mirror-maker.sh connect-mirror-maker.properties
<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>

    <p>
        After startup, it may take a few minutes until a MirrorMaker process first begins to replicate data.
    </p>

    <p>
        Optionally, as described previously, you can set the parameter <code>--clusters</code> to ensure that the MirrorMaker process produces data to nearby clusters only.
    </p>

    <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text"># Note: The cluster alias us-west must be defined in the configuration file

<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>

    <p>
        <em>Note when testing replication of consumer groups:</em> By default, MirrorMaker does not replicate consumer groups created by the  <code>kafka-console-consumer.sh</code> tool, which you might use to test your MirrorMaker setup on the command line. If you do want to replicate these consumer groups as well, set the <code>groups.exclude</code> configuration accordingly (default: <code>groups.exclude = console-consumer-.*, connect-.*, __.*</code>). Remember to update the configuration again once you completed your testing.

    <p>
        It is recommended to monitor MirrorMaker processes to ensure all defined replication flows are up and running correctly. MirrorMaker is built on the Connect framework and inherits all of Connect's metrics, such <code>source-record-poll-rate</code>. In addition, MirrorMaker produces its own metrics under the <code>kafka.connect.mirror</code> metric group. Metrics are tagged with the following properties:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><code>source</code>: alias of source cluster (e.g., <code>primary</code>)</li>
        <li><code>target</code>: alias of target cluster (e.g., <code>secondary</code>)</li>
        <li><code>topic</code>:  replicated topic on target cluster</li>
        <li><code>partition</code>: partition being replicated</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Metrics are tracked for each replicated topic. The source cluster can be inferred from the topic name. For example, replicating <code>topic1</code> from <code>primary-&gt;secondary</code> will yield metrics like:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><code>target=secondary</code>
        </li><li><code>topic=primary.topic1</code>
    </li><li><code>partition=1</code>

    <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="multitenancy-overview" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#multitenancy-overview">Multi-Tenancy Overview</a></h4>

    <p>
        As a highly scalable event streaming platform, Kafka is used by many users as their central nervous system, connecting in real-time a wide range of different systems and applications from various teams and lines of businesses. Such multi-tenant cluster environments command proper control and management to ensure the peaceful coexistence of these different needs. This section highlights features and best practices to set up such shared environments, which should help you operate clusters that meet SLAs/OLAs and that minimize potential collateral damage caused by "noisy neighbors".
    </p>

    <p>
        Multi-tenancy is a many-sided subject, including but not limited to:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Creating user spaces for tenants (sometimes called namespaces)</li>
        <li>Configuring topics with data retention policies and more</li>
        <li>Securing topics and clusters with encryption, authentication, and authorization</li>
        <li>Isolating tenants with quotas and rate limits</li>
        <li>Monitoring and metering</li>
        <li>Inter-cluster data sharing (cf. geo-replication)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="multitenancy-topic-naming" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#multitenancy-topic-naming">Creating User Spaces (Namespaces) For Tenants With Topic Naming</a></h4>

    <p>
        Kafka administrators operating a multi-tenant cluster typically need to define user spaces for each tenant. For the purpose of this section, "user spaces" are a collection of topics, which are grouped together under the management of a single entity or user.
    </p>

    <p>
        In Kafka, the main unit of data is the topic. Users can create and name each topic. They can also delete them, but it is not possible to rename a topic directly. Instead, to rename a topic, the user must create a new topic, move the messages from the original topic to the new, and then delete the original. With this in mind, it is recommended to define logical spaces, based on an hierarchical topic naming structure. This setup can then be combined with security features, such as prefixed ACLs, to isolate different spaces and tenants, while also minimizing the administrative overhead for securing the data in the cluster.
    </p>

    <p>
        These logical user spaces can be grouped in different ways, and the concrete choice depends on how your organization prefers to use your Kafka clusters. The most common groupings are as follows.
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>By team or organizational unit:</em> Here, the team is the main aggregator. In an organization where teams are the main user of the Kafka infrastructure, this might be the best grouping.
    </p>

    <p>
        Example topic naming structure:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><code>&lt;organization&gt;.&lt;team&gt;.&lt;dataset&gt;.&lt;event-name&gt;</code><br>(e.g., "acme.infosec.telemetry.logins")</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <em>By project or product:</em> Here, a team manages more than one project. Their credentials will be different for each project, so all the controls and settings will always be project related.
    </p>

    <p>
        Example topic naming structure:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><code>&lt;project&gt;.&lt;product&gt;.&lt;event-name&gt;</code><br>(e.g., "mobility.payments.suspicious")</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Certain information should normally not be put in a topic name, such as information that is likely to change over time (e.g., the name of the intended consumer) or that is a technical detail or metadata that is available elsewhere (e.g., the topic's partition count and other configuration settings).
    </p>

    <p>
        To enforce a topic naming structure, several options are available:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Use <a href="#security_authz">prefix ACLs</a> (cf. <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-290%3A+Support+for+Prefixed+ACLs">KIP-290</a>) to enforce a common prefix for topic names. For example, team A may only be permitted to create topics whose names start with <code>payments.teamA.</code>.</li>
        <li>Define a custom <code>CreateTopicPolicy</code> (cf. <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-108%3A+Create+Topic+Policy">KIP-108</a> and the setting <a href="#brokerconfigs_create.topic.policy.class.name">create.topic.policy.class.name</a>) to enforce strict naming patterns. These policies provide the most flexibility and can cover complex patterns and rules to match an organization's needs.</li>
        <li>Disable topic creation for normal users by denying it with an ACL, and then rely on an external process to create topics on behalf of users (e.g., scripting or your favorite automation toolkit).</li>
        <li>It may also be useful to disable the Kafka feature to auto-create topics on demand by setting <code>auto.create.topics.enable=false</code> in the broker configuration. Note that you should not rely solely on this option.</li>
    </ul>


    <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="multitenancy-topic-configs" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#multitenancy-topic-configs">Configuring Topics: Data Retention And More</a></h4>

    <p>
        Kafka's configuration is very flexible due to its fine granularity, and it supports a plethora of <a href="#topicconfigs">per-topic configuration settings</a> to help administrators set up multi-tenant clusters. For example, administrators often need to define data retention policies to control how much and/or for how long data will be stored in a topic, with settings such as <a href="#retention.bytes">retention.bytes</a> (size) and <a href="#retention.ms">retention.ms</a> (time). This limits storage consumption within the cluster, and helps complying with legal requirements such as GDPR.
    </p>

    <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="multitenancy-security" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#multitenancy-security">Securing Clusters and Topics: Authentication, Authorization, Encryption</a></h4>

    <p>
        Because the documentation has a dedicated chapter on <a href="#security">security</a> that applies to any Kafka deployment, this section focuses on additional considerations for multi-tenant environments.
    </p>

    <p>
        Security settings for Kafka fall into three main categories, which are similar to how administrators would secure other client-server data systems, like relational databases and traditional messaging systems.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Encryption</strong> of data transferred between Kafka brokers and Kafka clients, between brokers, between brokers and ZooKeeper nodes, and between brokers and other, optional tools.</li>
        <li><strong>Authentication</strong> of connections from Kafka clients and applications to Kafka brokers, as well as connections from Kafka brokers to ZooKeeper nodes.</li>
        <li><strong>Authorization</strong> of client operations such as creating, deleting, and altering the configuration of topics; writing events to or reading events from a topic; creating and deleting ACLs. Administrators can also define custom policies to put in place additional restrictions, such as a <code>CreateTopicPolicy</code> and <code>AlterConfigPolicy</code> (see <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-108%3A+Create+Topic+Policy">KIP-108</a> and the settings <a href="#brokerconfigs_create.topic.policy.class.name">create.topic.policy.class.name</a>, <a href="#brokerconfigs_alter.config.policy.class.name">alter.config.policy.class.name</a>).</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        When securing a multi-tenant Kafka environment, the most common administrative task is the third category (authorization), i.e., managing the user/client permissions that grant or deny access to certain topics and thus to the data stored by users within a cluster. This task is performed predominantly through the <a href="#security_authz">setting of access control lists (ACLs)</a>. Here, administrators of multi-tenant environments in particular benefit from putting a hierarchical topic naming structure in place as described in a previous section, because they can conveniently control access to topics through prefixed ACLs (<code>--resource-pattern-type Prefixed</code>). This significantly minimizes the administrative overhead of securing topics in multi-tenant environments: administrators can make their own trade-offs between higher developer convenience (more lenient permissions, using fewer and broader ACLs) vs. tighter security (more stringent permissions, using more and narrower ACLs).
    </p>

    <p>
        In the following example, user Alice—a new member of ACME corporation's InfoSec team—is granted write permissions to all topics whose names start with "acme.infosec.", such as "acme.infosec.telemetry.logins" and "acme.infosec.syslogs.events".
    </p>

    <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text"># Grant permissions to user Alice
$ bin/kafka-acls.sh \
    --bootstrap-server broker1:9092 \
    --add --allow-principal User:Alice \
    --producer \
    --resource-pattern-type prefixed --topic acme.infosec.
<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>

    <p>
        You can similarly use this approach to isolate different customers on the same shared cluster.
    </p>

    <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="multitenancy-isolation" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#multitenancy-isolation">Isolating Tenants: Quotas, Rate Limiting, Throttling</a></h4>

    <p>
        Multi-tenant clusters should generally be configured with <a href="#design_quotas">quotas</a>, which protect against users (tenants) eating up too many cluster resources, such as when they attempt to write or read very high volumes of data, or create requests to brokers at an excessively high rate. This may cause network saturation, monopolize broker resources, and impact other clients—all of which you want to avoid in a shared environment.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Client quotas:</strong> Kafka supports different types of (per-user principal) client quotas. Because a client's quotas apply irrespective of which topics the client is writing to or reading from, they are a convenient and effective tool to allocate resources in a multi-tenant cluster. <a href="#design_quotascpu">Request rate quotas</a>, for example, help to limit a user's impact on broker CPU usage by limiting the time a broker spends on the <a href="/protocol.html">request handling path</a> for that user, after which throttling kicks in. In many situations, isolating users with request rate quotas has a bigger impact in multi-tenant clusters than setting incoming/outgoing network bandwidth quotas, because excessive broker CPU usage for processing requests reduces the effective bandwidth the broker can serve. Furthermore, administrators can also define quotas on topic operations—such as create, delete, and alter—to prevent Kafka clusters from being overwhelmed by highly concurrent topic operations (see <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-599%3A+Throttle+Create+Topic%2C+Create+Partition+and+Delete+Topic+Operations">KIP-599</a> and the quota type <code>controller_mutation_rate</code>).
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Server quotas:</strong> Kafka also supports different types of broker-side quotas. For example, administrators can set a limit on the rate with which the <a href="#brokerconfigs_max.connection.creation.rate">broker accepts new connections</a>, set the <a href="#brokerconfigs_max.connections">maximum number of connections per broker</a>, or set the maximum number of connections allowed <a href="#brokerconfigs_max.connections.per.ip">from a specific IP address</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        For more information, please refer to the <a href="#design_quotas">quota overview</a> and <a href="#quotas">how to set quotas</a>.
    </p>

    <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="multitenancy-monitoring" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#multitenancy-monitoring">Monitoring and Metering</a></h4>

    <p>
        <a href="#monitoring">Monitoring</a> is a broader subject that is covered <a href="#monitoring">elsewhere</a> in the documentation. Administrators of any Kafka environment, but especially multi-tenant ones, should set up monitoring according to these instructions. Kafka supports a wide range of metrics, such as the rate of failed authentication attempts, request latency, consumer lag, total number of consumer groups, metrics on the quotas described in the previous section, and many more.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, monitoring can be configured to track the size of topic-partitions (with the JMX metric <code>kafka.log.Log.Size.&lt;TOPIC-NAME&gt;</code>), and thus the total size of data stored in a topic. You can then define alerts when tenants on shared clusters are getting close to using too much storage space.
    </p>

    <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="multitenancy-georeplication" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#multitenancy-georeplication">Multi-Tenancy and Geo-Replication</a></h4>

    <p>
        Kafka lets you share data across different clusters, which may be located in different geographical regions, data centers, and so on. Apart from use cases such as disaster recovery, this functionality is useful when a multi-tenant setup requires inter-cluster data sharing. See the section <a href="#georeplication">Geo-Replication (Cross-Cluster Data Mirroring)</a> for more information.
    </p>

    <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="multitenancy-more" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#multitenancy-more">Further considerations</a></h4>

    <p>
        <strong>Data contracts:</strong> You may need to define data contracts between the producers and the consumers of data in a cluster, using event schemas. This ensures that events written to Kafka can always be read properly again, and prevents malformed or corrupt events being written. The best way to achieve this is to deploy a so-called schema registry alongside the cluster. (Kafka does not include a schema registry, but there are third-party implementations available.) A schema registry manages the event schemas and maps the schemas to topics, so that producers know which topics are accepting which types (schemas) of events, and consumers know how to read and parse events in a topic. Some registry implementations provide further functionality, such as schema evolution, storing a history of all schemas, and schema compatibility settings.

    Our client configuration varies a fair amount between different use cases.

    <h3 class="anchor-heading"><a id="java" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#java">6.6 Java Version</a></h3>

    Java 8, Java 11, and Java 17 are supported. Note that Java 8 support has been deprecated since Apache Kafka 3.0 and will be removed in Apache Kafka 4.0.
    Java 11 and later versions perform significantly better if TLS is enabled, so they are highly recommended (they also include a number of other
    performance improvements: G1GC, CRC32C, Compact Strings, Thread-Local Handshakes and more).

    From a security perspective, we recommend the latest released patch version as older freely available versions have disclosed security vulnerabilities.

    Typical arguments for running Kafka with OpenJDK-based Java implementations (including Oracle JDK) are:

    <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">  -Xmx6g -Xms6g -XX:MetaspaceSize=96m -XX:+UseG1GC

    For reference, here are the stats for one of LinkedIn's busiest clusters (at peak) that uses said Java arguments:
    <ul>
        <li>60 brokers</li>
        <li>50k partitions (replication factor 2)</li>
        <li>800k messages/sec in</li>
        <li>300 MB/sec inbound, 1 GB/sec+ outbound</li>
    </ul>

    All of the brokers in that cluster have a 90% GC pause time of about 21ms with less than 1 young GC per second.

    <h3 class="anchor-heading"><a id="hwandos" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#hwandos">6.7 Hardware and OS</a></h3>
    We are using dual quad-core Intel Xeon machines with 24GB of memory.
    <p>
        You need sufficient memory to buffer active readers and writers. You can do a back-of-the-envelope estimate of memory needs by assuming you want to be able to buffer for 30 seconds and compute your memory need as write_throughput*30.
    </p><p>
    The disk throughput is important. We have 8x7200 rpm SATA drives. In general disk throughput is the performance bottleneck, and more disks is better. Depending on how you configure flush behavior you may or may not benefit from more expensive disks (if you force flush often then higher RPM SAS drives may be better).

</p><h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="os" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#os">OS</a></h4>
    Kafka should run well on any unix system and has been tested on Linux and Solaris.
    <p>
        We have seen a few issues running on Windows and Windows is not currently a well supported platform though we would be happy to change that.
    </p><p>
    It is unlikely to require much OS-level tuning, but there are three potentially important OS-level configurations:
</p><ul>
    <li>File descriptor limits: Kafka uses file descriptors for log segments and open connections. If a broker hosts many partitions, consider that the broker needs at least (number_of_partitions)*(partition_size/segment_size) to track all log segments in addition to the number of connections the broker makes. We recommend at least 100000 allowed file descriptors for the broker processes as a starting point. Note: The mmap() function adds an extra reference to the file associated with the file descriptor fildes which is not removed by a subsequent close() on that file descriptor. This reference is removed when there are no more mappings to the file.
    </li><li>Max socket buffer size: can be increased to enable high-performance data transfer between data centers as <a href="http://www.psc.edu/index.php/networking/641-tcp-tune">described here</a>.
</li><li>Maximum number of memory map areas a process may have (aka vm.max_map_count). <a href="http://kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt">See the Linux kernel documentation</a>. You should keep an eye at this OS-level property when considering the maximum number of partitions a broker may have. By default, on a number of Linux systems, the value of vm.max_map_count is somewhere around 65535. Each log segment, allocated per partition, requires a pair of index/timeindex files, and each of these files consumes 1 map area. In other words, each log segment uses 2 map areas. Thus, each partition requires minimum 2 map areas, as long as it hosts a single log segment. That is to say, creating 50000 partitions on a broker will result allocation of 100000 map areas and likely cause broker crash with OutOfMemoryError (Map failed) on a system with default vm.max_map_count. Keep in mind that the number of log segments per partition varies depending on the segment size, load intensity, retention policy and, generally, tends to be more than one.
</li></ul>
    <p>

    </p><h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="diskandfs" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#diskandfs">Disks and Filesystem</a></h4>
    We recommend using multiple drives to get good throughput and not sharing the same drives used for Kafka data with application logs or other OS filesystem activity to ensure good latency. You can either RAID these drives together into a single volume or format and mount each drive as its own directory. Since Kafka has replication the redundancy provided by RAID can also be provided at the application level. This choice has several tradeoffs.
    <p>
        If you configure multiple data directories partitions will be assigned round-robin to data directories. Each partition will be entirely in one of the data directories. If data is not well balanced among partitions this can lead to load imbalance between disks.
    </p><p>
    RAID can potentially do better at balancing load between disks (although it doesn't always seem to) because it balances load at a lower level. The primary downside of RAID is that it is usually a big performance hit for write throughput and reduces the available disk space.
</p><p>
    Another potential benefit of RAID is the ability to tolerate disk failures. However our experience has been that rebuilding the RAID array is so I/O intensive that it effectively disables the server, so this does not provide much real availability improvement.

</p><h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="appvsosflush" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#appvsosflush">Application vs. OS Flush Management</a></h4>
    Kafka always immediately writes all data to the filesystem and supports the ability to configure the flush policy that controls when data is forced out of the OS cache and onto disk using the flush. This flush policy can be controlled to force data to disk after a period of time or after a certain number of messages has been written. There are several choices in this configuration.
    <p>
        Kafka must eventually call fsync to know that data was flushed. When recovering from a crash for any log segment not known to be fsync'd Kafka will check the integrity of each message by checking its CRC and also rebuild the accompanying offset index file as part of the recovery process executed on startup.
    </p><p>
    Note that durability in Kafka does not require syncing data to disk, as a failed node will always recover from its replicas.
</p><p>
    We recommend using the default flush settings which disable application fsync entirely. This means relying on the background flush done by the OS and Kafka's own background flush. This provides the best of all worlds for most uses: no knobs to tune, great throughput and latency, and full recovery guarantees. We generally feel that the guarantees provided by replication are stronger than sync to local disk, however the paranoid still may prefer having both and application level fsync policies are still supported.
</p><p>
    The drawback of using application level flush settings is that it is less efficient in its disk usage pattern (it gives the OS less leeway to re-order writes) and it can introduce latency as fsync in most Linux filesystems blocks writes to the file whereas the background flushing does much more granular page-level locking.
</p><p>
    In general you don't need to do any low-level tuning of the filesystem, but in the next few sections we will go over some of this in case it is useful.

</p><h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="linuxflush" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#linuxflush">Understanding Linux OS Flush Behavior</a></h4>

    In Linux, data written to the filesystem is maintained in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_cache">pagecache</a> until it must be written out to disk (due to an application-level fsync or the OS's own flush policy). The flushing of data is done by a set of background threads called pdflush (or in post 2.6.32 kernels "flusher threads").

        Pdflush has a configurable policy that controls how much dirty data can be maintained in cache and for how long before it must be written back to disk.
        This policy is described <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160518040713/http://www.westnet.com/~gsmith/content/linux-pdflush.htm">here</a>.
        When Pdflush cannot keep up with the rate of data being written it will eventually cause the writing process to block incurring latency in the writes to slow down the accumulation of data.

    You can see the current state of OS memory usage by doing
</p><pre class="language-bash"> &gt; cat /proc/meminfo </pre>
    The meaning of these values are described in the link above.
    <p>
        Using pagecache has several advantages over an in-process cache for storing data that will be written out to disk:
    </p><ul>
    <li>The I/O scheduler will batch together consecutive small writes into bigger physical writes which improves throughput.
    </li><li>The I/O scheduler will attempt to re-sequence writes to minimize movement of the disk head which improves throughput.
</li><li>It automatically uses all the free memory on the machine
</li></ul>

    <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="filesystems" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#filesystems">Filesystem Selection</a></h4>
    <p>Kafka uses regular files on disk, and as such it has no hard dependency on a specific filesystem. The two filesystems which have the most usage, however, are EXT4 and XFS. Historically, EXT4 has had more usage, but recent improvements to the XFS filesystem have shown it to have better performance characteristics for Kafka's workload with no compromise in stability.</p>
    <p>Comparison testing was performed on a cluster with significant message loads, using a variety of filesystem creation and mount options. The primary metric in Kafka that was monitored was the "Request Local Time", indicating the amount of time append operations were taking. XFS resulted in much better local times (160ms vs. 250ms+ for the best EXT4 configuration), as well as lower average wait times. The XFS performance also showed less variability in disk performance.</p>
    <h5 class="anchor-heading"><a id="generalfs" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#generalfs">General Filesystem Notes</a></h5>
    For any filesystem used for data directories, on Linux systems, the following options are recommended to be used at mount time:
    <ul>
        <li>noatime: This option disables updating of a file's atime (last access time) attribute when the file is read. This can eliminate a significant number of filesystem writes, especially in the case of bootstrapping consumers. Kafka does not rely on the atime attributes at all, so it is safe to disable this.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5 class="anchor-heading"><a id="xfs" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#xfs">XFS Notes</a></h5>
    The XFS filesystem has a significant amount of auto-tuning in place, so it does not require any change in the default settings, either at filesystem creation time or at mount. The only tuning parameters worth considering are:
    <ul>
        <li>largeio: This affects the preferred I/O size reported by the stat call. While this can allow for higher performance on larger disk writes, in practice it had minimal or no effect on performance.</li>
        <li>nobarrier: For underlying devices that have battery-backed cache, this option can provide a little more performance by disabling periodic write flushes. However, if the underlying device is well-behaved, it will report to the filesystem that it does not require flushes, and this option will have no effect.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5 class="anchor-heading"><a id="ext4" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#ext4">EXT4 Notes</a></h5>
    EXT4 is a serviceable choice of filesystem for the Kafka data directories, however getting the most performance out of it will require adjusting several mount options. In addition, these options are generally unsafe in a failure scenario, and will result in much more data loss and corruption. For a single broker failure, this is not much of a concern as the disk can be wiped and the replicas rebuilt from the cluster. In a multiple-failure scenario, such as a power outage, this can mean underlying filesystem (and therefore data) corruption that is not easily recoverable. The following options can be adjusted:
    <ul>
        <li>data=writeback: Ext4 defaults to data=ordered which puts a strong order on some writes. Kafka does not require this ordering as it does very paranoid data recovery on all unflushed log. This setting removes the ordering constraint and seems to significantly reduce latency.
        </li><li>Disabling journaling: Journaling is a tradeoff: it makes reboots faster after server crashes but it introduces a great deal of additional locking which adds variance to write performance. Those who don't care about reboot time and want to reduce a major source of write latency spikes can turn off journaling entirely.
    </li><li>commit=num_secs: This tunes the frequency with which ext4 commits to its metadata journal. Setting this to a lower value reduces the loss of unflushed data during a crash. Setting this to a higher value will improve throughput.
    </li><li>nobh: This setting controls additional ordering guarantees when using data=writeback mode. This should be safe with Kafka as we do not depend on write ordering and improves throughput and latency.
    </li><li>delalloc: Delayed allocation means that the filesystem avoid allocating any blocks until the physical write occurs. This allows ext4 to allocate a large extent instead of smaller pages and helps ensure the data is written sequentially. This feature is great for throughput. It does seem to involve some locking in the filesystem which adds a bit of latency variance.
    </li></ul>

    <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="replace_disk" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#replace_disk">Replace KRaft Controller Disk</a></h4>
    <p>When Kafka is configured to use KRaft, the controllers store the cluster metadata in the directory specified in <code>metadata.log.dir</code> -- or the first log directory, if <code>metadata.log.dir</code> is not configured. See the documentation for <code>metadata.log.dir</code> for details.</p>

    <p>If the data in the cluster metadata directory is lost either because of hardware failure or the hardware needs to be replaced, care should be taken when provisioning the new controller node. The new controller node should not be formatted and started until the majority of the controllers have all of the committed data. To determine if the majority of the controllers have the committed data, run the <code>kafka-metadata-quorum.sh</code> tool to describe the replication status:</p>

    <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"> <span class="token operator">&gt;</span> bin/kafka-metadata-quorum.sh --bootstrap-server broker_host:port describe --replication
 NodeId  LogEndOffset    Lag     LastFetchTimestamp      LastCaughtUpTimestamp   Status
 <span class="token number">1</span>       <span class="token number">25806</span>           <span class="token number">0</span>       <span class="token number">1662500992757</span>           <span class="token number">1662500992757</span>           Leader
 <span class="token punctuation">..</span>.     <span class="token punctuation">..</span>.             <span class="token punctuation">..</span>.     <span class="token punctuation">..</span>.                     <span class="token punctuation">..</span>.                     <span class="token punctuation">..</span>.
  <span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>

    <p>Check and wait until the <code>Lag</code> is small for a majority of the controllers. If the leader's end offset is not increasing, you can wait until the lag is 0 for a majority; otherwise, you can pick the latest leader end offset and wait until all replicas have reached it. Check and wait until the <code>LastFetchTimestamp</code> and <code>LastCaughtUpTimestamp</code> are close to each other for the majority of the controllers. At this point it is safer to format the controller's metadata log directory. This can be done by running the <code>kafka-storage.sh</code> command.</p>

    <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"> <span class="token operator">&gt;</span> bin/kafka-storage.sh <span class="token function">format</span> --cluster-id uuid --config server_properties<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>

    <p>It is possible for the <code>bin/kafka-storage.sh format</code> command above to fail with a message like <code>Log directory ... is already formatted</code>. This can happen when combined mode is used and only the metadata log directory was lost but not the others. In that case and only in that case, can you run the <code>kafka-storage.sh format</code> command with the <code>--ignore-formatted</code> option.</p>

    <p>Start the KRaft controller after formatting the log directories.</p>

    <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"> <span class="token operator">&gt;</span> /bin/kafka-server-start.sh server_properties<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>

    <h3 class="anchor-heading"><a id="monitoring" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#monitoring">6.8 Monitoring</a></h3>

    Kafka uses Yammer Metrics for metrics reporting in the server. The Java clients use Kafka Metrics, a built-in metrics registry that minimizes transitive dependencies pulled into client applications. Both expose metrics via JMX and can be configured to report stats using pluggable stats reporters to hook up to your monitoring system.
    <p>
        All Kafka rate metrics have a corresponding cumulative count metric with suffix <code>-total</code>. For example,
        <code>records-consumed-rate</code> has a corresponding metric named <code>records-consumed-total</code>.
    </p><p>
    The easiest way to see the available metrics is to fire up jconsole and point it at a running kafka client or server; this will allow browsing all metrics with JMX.

</p><h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="remote_jmx" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#remote_jmx">Security Considerations for Remote Monitoring using JMX</a></h4>
    Apache Kafka disables remote JMX by default. You can enable remote monitoring using JMX by setting the environment variable
    <code>JMX_PORT</code> for processes started using the CLI or standard Java system properties to enable remote JMX programmatically.
    You must enable security when enabling remote JMX in production scenarios to ensure that unauthorized users cannot monitor or
    control your broker or application as well as the platform on which these are running. Note that authentication is disabled for
    JMX by default in Kafka and security configs must be overridden for production deployments by setting the environment variable
    <code>KAFKA_JMX_OPTS</code> for processes started using the CLI or by setting appropriate Java system properties. See
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/management/agent.html">Monitoring and Management Using JMX Technology</a>

    Statistics collected by RocksDB provide cumulative measurements over time, e.g. bytes written to the state store.
    Properties exposed by RocksDB provide current measurements, e.g., the amount of memory currently used.
    Note that the <code>store-scope</code> for built-in RocksDB state stores are currently the following:
    <ul>

    statistics in <a href="https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Statistics#stats-level-and-performance-costs">RocksDB
    may have an impact on performance</a>.
    Statistics-based metrics are collected every minute from the RocksDB state stores.
    If a state store consists of multiple RocksDB instances, as is the case for WindowStores and SessionStores,
    each metric reports an aggregation over the RocksDB instances of the state store.

    If a state store consists of multiple RocksDB instances, as is the case for WindowStores and SessionStores,
    each metric reports the sum over all the RocksDB instances of the state store, except for the block cache metrics
    <code>block-cache-*</code>. The block cache metrics report the sum over all RocksDB instances if each instance uses its
    own block cache, and they report the recorded value from only one instance if a single block cache is shared
    among all instances.

    On the client side, we recommend monitoring the message/byte rate (global and per topic), request rate/size/time, and on the consumer side, max lag in messages among all partitions and min fetch request rate. For a consumer to keep up, max lag needs to be less than a threshold and min fetch rate needs to be larger than 0.

    <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="zkops" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#zkops">Operationalizing ZooKeeper</a></h4>
    Operationally, we do the following for a healthy ZooKeeper installation:
    <ul>
        <li>Redundancy in the physical/hardware/network layout: try not to put them all in the same rack, decent (but don't go nuts) hardware, try to keep redundant power and network paths, etc. A typical ZooKeeper ensemble has 5 or 7 servers, which tolerates 2 and 3 servers down, respectively. If you have a small deployment, then using 3 servers is acceptable, but keep in mind that you'll only be able to tolerate 1 server down in this case. </li>
        <li>I/O segregation: if you do a lot of write type traffic you'll almost definitely want the transaction logs on a dedicated disk group. Writes to the transaction log are synchronous (but batched for performance), and consequently, concurrent writes can significantly affect performance. ZooKeeper snapshots can be one such a source of concurrent writes, and ideally should be written on a disk group separate from the transaction log. Snapshots are written to disk asynchronously, so it is typically ok to share with the operating system and message log files. You can configure a server to use a separate disk group with the dataLogDir parameter.</li>
        <li>Application segregation: Unless you really understand the application patterns of other apps that you want to install on the same box, it can be a good idea to run ZooKeeper in isolation (though this can be a balancing act with the capabilities of the hardware).</li>
        <li>Use care with virtualization: It can work, depending on your cluster layout and read/write patterns and SLAs, but the tiny overheads introduced by the virtualization layer can add up and throw off ZooKeeper, as it can be very time sensitive</li>
        <li>ZooKeeper configuration: It's java, make sure you give it 'enough' heap space (We usually run them with 3-5G, but that's mostly due to the data set size we have here). Unfortunately we don't have a good formula for it, but keep in mind that allowing for more ZooKeeper state means that snapshots can become large, and large snapshots affect recovery time. In fact, if the snapshot becomes too large (a few gigabytes), then you may need to increase the initLimit parameter to give enough time for servers to recover and join the ensemble.</li>
        <li>Monitoring: Both JMX and the 4 letter words (4lw) commands are very useful, they do overlap in some cases (and in those cases we prefer the 4 letter commands, they seem more predictable, or at the very least, they work better with the LI monitoring infrastructure)</li>
        <li>Don't overbuild the cluster: large clusters, especially in a write heavy usage pattern, means a lot of intracluster communication (quorums on the writes and subsequent cluster member updates), but don't underbuild it (and risk swamping the cluster). Having more servers adds to your read capacity.</li>
    </ul>
    Overall, we try to keep the ZooKeeper system as small as will handle the load (plus standard growth capacity planning) and as simple as possible. We try not to do anything fancy with the configuration or application layout as compared to the official release as well as keep it as self contained as possible. For these reasons, we tend to skip the OS packaged versions, since it has a tendency to try to put things in the OS standard hierarchy, which can be 'messy', for want of a better way to word it.

    <p>In KRaft mode each Kafka server can be configured as a controller, a broker, or both using the <code>process.roles</code> property. This property can have the following values:</p>

    <ul>

        <li>If <code>process.roles</code> is set to <code>controller</code>, the server acts as a controller.</li>
        <li>If <code>process.roles</code> is set to <code>broker,controller</code>, the server acts as both a broker and a controller.</li>
        <li>If <code>process.roles</code> is not set at all, it is assumed to be in ZooKeeper mode.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Kafka servers that act as both brokers and controllers are referred to as "combined" servers. Combined servers are simpler to operate for small use cases like a development environment. The key disadvantage is that the controller will be less isolated from the rest of the system. For example, it is not possible to roll or scale the controllers separately from the brokers in combined mode. Combined mode is not recommended in critical deployment environments.</p>


    <h5 class="anchor-heading"><a id="kraft_voter" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#kraft_voter">Controllers</a></h5>

    <p>In KRaft mode, specific Kafka servers are selected to be controllers (unlike the ZooKeeper-based mode, where any server can become the Controller). The servers selected to be controllers will participate in the metadata quorum. Each controller is either an active or a hot standby for the current active controller.</p>

    <p>A Kafka admin will typically select 3 or 5 servers for this role, depending on factors like cost and the number of concurrent failures your system should withstand without availability impact. A majority of the controllers must be alive in order to maintain availability. With 3 controllers, the cluster can tolerate 1 controller failure; with 5 controllers, the cluster can tolerate 2 controller failures.</p>

    <p>All of the servers in a Kafka cluster discover the quorum voters using the <code>controller.quorum.voters</code> property. This identifies the quorum controller servers that should be used. All the controllers must be enumerated. Each controller is identified with their <code>id</code>, <code>host</code> and <code>port</code> information. For example:</p>

    <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash">controller.quorum.voters<span class="token operator">=</span>id1@host1:port1,id2@host2:port2,id3@host3:port3<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>

    <p>If a Kafka cluster has 3 controllers named controller1, controller2 and controller3, then controller1 may have the following configuration:</p>

    <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash">
process.roles<span class="token operator">=</span>controller
node.id<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token number">1</span>
<span class="token assign-left variable">listeners</span><span class="token operator">=</span>CONTROLLER://controller1.example.com:9093
controller.quorum.voters<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token number">1</span>@controller1.example.com:9093,2@controller2.example.com:9093,3@controller3.example.com:9093<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>

    <p>Every broker and controller must set the <code>controller.quorum.voters</code> property. The node ID supplied in the <code>controller.quorum.voters</code> property must match the corresponding id on the controller servers. For example, on controller1, node.id must be set to 1, and so forth. Each node ID must be unique across all the servers in a particular cluster. No two servers can have the same node ID regardless of their <code>process.roles</code> values.

    </p><h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="kraft_storage" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#kraft_storage">Storage Tool</a></h4>
    <p></p>
    The <code>kafka-storage.sh random-uuid</code> command can be used to generate a cluster ID for your new cluster. This cluster ID must be used when formatting each server in the cluster with the <code>kafka-storage.sh format</code> command.

    <p>This is different from how Kafka has operated in the past. Previously, Kafka would format blank storage directories automatically, and also generate a new cluster ID automatically. One reason for the change is that auto-formatting can sometimes obscure an error condition. This is particularly important for the metadata log maintained by the controller and broker servers. If a majority of the controllers were able to start with an empty log directory, a leader might be able to be elected with missing committed data.</p>

    <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="kraft_deployment" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#kraft_deployment">Deploying Considerations</a></h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Kafka server's <code>process.role</code> should be set to either <code>broker</code> or <code>controller</code> but not both. Combined mode can be used in development environments, but it should be avoided in critical deployment environments.</li>
        <li>For redundancy, a Kafka cluster should use 3 controllers. More than 3 controllers is not recommended in critical environments. In the rare case of a partial network failure it is possible for the cluster metadata quorum to become unavailable. This limitation will be addressed in a future release of Kafka.</li>
        <li>The Kafka controllers store all the metadata for the cluster in memory and on disk. We believe that for a typical Kafka cluster 5GB of main memory and 5GB of disk space on the metadata log director is sufficient.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="kraft_missing" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#kraft_missing">Missing Features</a></h4>

    <p>The following features are not fully implemented in KRaft mode:</p>

    <p>
        <b>ZooKeeper to KRaft migration is considered an Early Access feature and is not recommended for production clusters.</b>
    </p>

    <p>The following features are not yet supported for ZK to KRaft migrations:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Downgrading to ZooKeeper mode during or after the migration</li>
        <li>Other features <a href="#kraft_missing">not yet supported in KRaft</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Please report issues with ZooKeeper to KRaft migration using the
        <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/KAFKA" target="_blank">project JIRA</a> and the "kraft" component.
    </p>

    <h3>Terminology</h3>
    <p>
        We use the term "migration" here to refer to the process of changing a Kafka cluster's metadata
        system from ZooKeeper to KRaft and migrating existing metadata. An "upgrade" refers to installing a newer version of Kafka. It is not recommended to
        upgrade the software at the same time as performing a metadata migration.
    </p>

    <p>
        We also use the term "ZK mode" to refer to Kafka brokers which are using ZooKeeper as their metadata
        system. "KRaft mode" refers Kafka brokers which are using a KRaft controller quorum as their metadata system.
    </p>

    <h3>Preparing for migration</h3>
    <p>
        Before beginning the migration, the Kafka brokers must be upgraded to software version 3.5.0 and have the
        "inter.broker.protocol.version" configuration set to "3.5". See <a href="#upgrade_3_5_0">Upgrading to 3.5.0</a> for
        upgrade instructions.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is recommended to enable TRACE level logging for the migration components while the migration is active. This can
        be done by adding the following log4j configuration to each KRaft controller's "log4j.properties" file.
    </p>

    <pre>log4j.logger.org.apache.kafka.metadata.migration=TRACE</pre>

    <p>
        It is generally useful to enable DEBUG logging on the KRaft controllers and the ZK brokers during the migration.
    </p>

    <h3>Provisioning the KRaft controller quorum</h3>
    <p>
        Two things are needed before the migration can begin. First, the brokers must be configured to support the migration and second,
        a KRaft controller quorum must be deployed. The KRaft controllers should be provisioned with the same cluster ID as
        the existing Kafka cluster. This can be found by examining one of the "meta.properties" files in the data directories
        of the brokers, or by running the following command.
    </p>

    <pre>./bin/zookeeper-shell.sh localhost:2181 get /cluster/id</pre>

    <p>
        The KRaft controller quorum should also be provisioned with the latest <code>metadata.version</code>.
        This is done automatically when you format the node with the <code>kafka-storage.sh</code> tool.
        For further instructions on KRaft deployment, please refer to <a href="#kraft_config">the above documentation</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        In addition to the standard KRaft configuration, the KRaft controllers will need to enable support for the migration
        as well as provide ZooKeeper connection configuration.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here is a sample config for a KRaft controller that is ready for migration:
    </p>
    <pre># Sample KRaft cluster controller.properties listening on 9093
process.roles=controller
node.id=3000
controller.quorum.voters=3000@localhost:9093
controller.listener.names=CONTROLLER
listeners=CONTROLLER://:9093

# Enable the migration
zookeeper.metadata.migration.enable=true

# ZooKeeper client configuration
zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181

# Other configs ...</pre>

    <p><em>Note: The KRaft cluster <code>node.id</code> values must be different from any existing ZK broker <code>broker.id</code>.
        In KRaft-mode, the brokers and controllers share the same Node ID namespace.</em></p>

    <h3>Enabling the migration on the brokers</h3>
    <p>
        Once the KRaft controller quorum has been started, the brokers will need to be reconfigured and restarted. Brokers
        may be restarted in a rolling fashion to avoid impacting cluster availability. Each broker requires the
        following configuration to communicate with the KRaft controllers and to enable the migration.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="#brokerconfigs_controller.quorum.voters">controller.quorum.voters</a></li>
        <li><a href="#brokerconfigs_controller.listener.names">controller.listener.names</a></li>
        <li>The controller.listener.name should also be added to <a href="#brokerconfigs_listener.security.protocol.map">listener.security.property.map</a></li>
        <li><a href="#brokerconfigs_zookeeper.metadata.migration.enable">zookeeper.metadata.migration.enable</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here is a sample config for a broker that is ready for migration:</p>

    <pre># Sample ZK broker server.properties listening on 9092
broker.id=0
listeners=PLAINTEXT://:9092
advertised.listeners=PLAINTEXT://localhost:9092
listener.security.protocol.map=PLAINTEXT:PLAINTEXT,CONTROLLER:PLAINTEXT

# Set the IBP
inter.broker.protocol.version=3.5

# Enable the migration
zookeeper.metadata.migration.enable=true

# ZooKeeper client configuration
zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181

# KRaft controller quorum configuration
controller.quorum.voters=3000@localhost:9093
controller.listener.names=CONTROLLER</pre>

    <p>
        <em>Note: Once the final ZK broker has been restarted with the necessary configuration, the migration will automatically begin.</em>
        When the migration is complete, an INFO level log can be observed on the active controller:
    </p>

    <pre>Completed migration of metadata from Zookeeper to KRaft</pre>

    <h3>Migrating brokers to KRaft</h3>
    <p>
        Once the KRaft controller completes the metadata migration, the brokers will still be running in ZK mode. While the
        KRaft controller is in migration mode, it will continue sending controller RPCs to the ZK mode brokers. This includes
        RPCs like UpdateMetadata and LeaderAndIsr.
    </p>

    <p>
        To migrate the brokers to KRaft, they simply need to be reconfigured as KRaft brokers and restarted. Using the above
        broker configuration as an example, we would replace the <code>broker.id</code> with <code>node.id</code> and add
        <code>process.roles=broker</code>. It is important that the broker maintain the same Broker/Node ID when it is restarted.
        The zookeeper configurations should be removed at this point.
    </p>

    <pre># Sample KRaft broker server.properties listening on 9092
process.roles=broker
node.id=0
listeners=PLAINTEXT://:9092
advertised.listeners=PLAINTEXT://localhost:9092
listener.security.protocol.map=PLAINTEXT:PLAINTEXT,CONTROLLER:PLAINTEXT

# Don't set the IBP, KRaft uses "metadata.version" feature flag
# inter.broker.protocol.version=3.5

# Remove the migration enabled flag
# zookeeper.metadata.migration.enable=true

# Remove ZooKeeper client configuration
# zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181

# Keep the KRaft controller quorum configuration
controller.quorum.voters=3000@localhost:9093
controller.listener.names=CONTROLLER</pre>

    <p>
        Each broker is restarted with a KRaft configuration until the entire cluster is running in KRaft mode.
    </p>

    <h3>Finalizing the migration</h3>
    <p>
        Once all brokers have been restarted in KRaft mode, the last step to finalize the migration is to take the
        KRaft controllers out of migration mode. This is done by removing the "zookeeper.metadata.migration.enable"
        property from each of their configs and restarting them one at a time.
    </p>

    <pre># Sample KRaft cluster controller.properties listening on 9093
process.roles=controller
node.id=3000
controller.quorum.voters=3000@localhost:9093
controller.listener.names=CONTROLLER
listeners=CONTROLLER://:9093

# Disable the migration
# zookeeper.metadata.migration.enable=true

# Remove ZooKeeper client configuration
# zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181

# Other configs ...</pre>


    <h3 class="anchor-heading"><a id="tiered_storage" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#kraft">6.11 Tiered Storage</a></h3>

    <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="tiered_storage_overview" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#tiered_storage_overview">Tiered Storage Overview</a></h4>

    <p>Kafka data is mostly consumed in a streaming fashion using tail reads. Tail reads leverage OS's page cache to serve the data instead of disk reads.
        Older data is typically read from the disk for backfill or failure recovery purposes and is infrequent.</p>

    <p>In the tiered storage approach, Kafka cluster is configured with two tiers of storage - local and remote.
        The local tier is the same as the current Kafka that uses the local disks on the Kafka brokers to store the log segments.
        The new remote tier uses external storage systems, such as HDFS or S3, to store the completed log segments.
        Please check <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-405%3A+Kafka+Tiered+Storage">KIP-405</a> for more information.
    </p>

    <p><b>Note: Tiered storage is considered as an early access feature, and is not recommended for use in production environments</b></p>

    <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="tiered_storage_config" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#tiered_storage_config">Configuration</a></h4>

    <h5 class="anchor-heading"><a id="tiered_storage_config_broker" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#tiered_storage_config_broker">Broker Configurations</a></h5>

    <p>By default, Kafka server will not enable tiered storage feature. <code>remote.log.storage.system.enable</code>
        is the property to control whether to enable tiered storage functionality in a broker or not. Setting it to "true" enables this feature.
    </p>

    <p><code>RemoteStorageManager</code> is an interface to provide the lifecycle of remote log segments and indexes. Kafka server
        doesn't provide out-of-the-box implementation of RemoteStorageManager. Configuring <code>remote.log.storage.manager.class.name</code>
        and <code>remote.log.storage.manager.class.path</code> to specify the implementation of RemoteStorageManager.
    </p>

    <p><code>RemoteLogMetadataManager</code> is an interface to provide the lifecycle of metadata about remote log segments with strongly consistent semantics.
        By default, Kafka provides an implementation with storage as an internal topic. This implementation can be changed by configuring
        <code>remote.log.metadata.manager.class.name</code> and <code>remote.log.metadata.manager.class.path</code>.
        When adopting the default kafka internal topic based implementation, <code>remote.log.metadata.manager.listener.name</code>
        is a mandatory property to specify which listener the clients created by the default RemoteLogMetadataManager implementation.
    </p>


    <h5 class="anchor-heading"><a id="tiered_storage_config_topic" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#tiered_storage_config_topic">Topic Configurations</a></h5>

    <p>After correctly configuring broker side configurations for tiered storage feature, there are still configurations in topic level needed to be set.
        <code>remote.storage.enable</code> is the switch to determine if a topic wants to use tiered storage or not. By default it is set to false.
        After enabling <code>remote.storage.enable</code> property, the next thing to consider is the log retention.
        When tiered storage is enabled for a topic, there are 2 additional log retention configurations to set:

    </p><ul>
    <li><code>local.retention.ms</code></li>
    <li><code>retention.ms</code></li>
    <li><code>local.retention.bytes</code></li>
    <li><code>retention.bytes</code></li>
</ul>

    The configuration prefixed with <code>local</code> are to specify the time/size the "local" log file can accept before moving to remote storage, and then get deleted.
    If unset, The value in <code>retention.ms</code> and <code>retention.bytes</code> will be used.
    <p></p>

    <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="tiered_storage_config_ex" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#tiered_storage_config_ex">Quick Start Example</a></h4>

    <p>Apache Kafka doesn't provide an out-of-the-box RemoteStorageManager implementation. To have a preview of the tiered storage

    <p>To adopt the `LocalTieredStorage`, the test library needs to be built locally</p>
    <pre># please checkout to the specific version tag you're using before building it
# ex: `git checkout 3.6.1`
./gradlew clean :storage:testJar</pre>
    <p>After build successfully, there should be a `kafka-storage-x.x.x-test.jar` file under `storage/build/libs`.

    <pre>bin/kafka-producer-perf-test.sh --topic tieredTopic --num-records 1200 --record-size 1024 --throughput -1 --producer-props bootstrap.servers=localhost:9092
</pre>

    <p>Then, after the active segment is rolled, the old segment should be moved to the remote storage and get deleted.
        This can be verified by checking the remote log directory configured above. For example:
    </p>

    <pre> &gt; ls /tmp/kafka-remote-storage/kafka-tiered-storage/tieredTopic-0-jF8s79t9SrG_PNqlwv7bAA
00000000000000000000-knnxbs3FSRyKdPcSAOQC-w.index
00000000000000000000-knnxbs3FSRyKdPcSAOQC-w.snapshot
00000000000000000000-knnxbs3FSRyKdPcSAOQC-w.leader_epoch_checkpoint
00000000000000000000-knnxbs3FSRyKdPcSAOQC-w.timeindex
00000000000000000000-knnxbs3FSRyKdPcSAOQC-w.log
</pre>

    <p>Lastly, we can try to consume some data from the beginning and print offset number, to make sure it will successfully fetch offset 0 from the remote storage.</p>

    <pre>bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic tieredTopic --from-beginning --max-messages 1 --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --property print.offset=true</pre>

    <p>Please note, if you want to disable tiered storage at the cluster level, you should delete the tiered storage enabled topics explicitly.
        Attempting to disable tiered storage at the cluster level without deleting the topics using tiered storage will result in an exception during startup.</p>

    <pre>bin/kafka-topics.sh --delete --topic tieredTopic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092</pre>

    <p>After topics are deleted, you're safe to set <code>remote.log.storage.system.enable=false</code> in the broker configuration.</p>

    <div class="p-security">
        <h3 class="anchor-heading"><a id="security_overview" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#security_overview">7.1 Security Overview</a></h3>
        In release 0.9.0.0, the Kafka community added a number of features that, used either separately or together, increases security in a Kafka cluster. The following security measures are currently supported:
        <ol>
            <li>Authentication of connections to brokers from clients (producers and consumers), other brokers and tools, using either SSL or SASL. Kafka supports the following SASL mechanisms:
                <ul>
                    <li>SASL/GSSAPI (Kerberos) - starting at version 0.9.0.0</li>
                    <li>SASL/PLAIN - starting at version 0.10.0.0</li>
                    <li>SASL/SCRAM-SHA-256 and SASL/SCRAM-SHA-512 - starting at version 0.10.2.0</li>
                    <li>SASL/OAUTHBEARER - starting at version 2.0</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>Authentication of connections from brokers to ZooKeeper</li>
            <li>Encryption of data transferred between brokers and clients, between brokers, or between brokers and tools using SSL (Note that there is a performance degradation when SSL is enabled, the magnitude of which depends on the CPU type and the JVM implementation.)</li>
            <li>Authorization of read / write operations by clients</li>
            <li>Authorization is pluggable and integration with external authorization services is supported</li>
        </ol>

        It's worth noting that security is optional - non-secured clusters are supported, as well as a mix of authenticated, unauthenticated, encrypted and non-encrypted clients.

        The guides below explain how to configure and use the security features in both clients and brokers.

        <h3 class="anchor-heading"><a id="listener_configuration" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#listener_configuration">7.2 Listener Configuration</a></h3>

        <p>In order to secure a Kafka cluster, it is necessary to secure the channels that are used to
            communicate with the servers. Each server must define the set of listeners that are used to
            receive requests from clients as well as other servers. Each listener may be configured
            to authenticate clients using various mechanisms and to ensure traffic between the
            server and the client is encrypted. This section provides a primer for the configuration
            of listeners.</p>

        <p>Kafka servers support listening for connections on multiple ports. This is configured through
            the <code>listeners</code> property in the server configuration, which accepts a comma-separated
            list of the listeners to enable. At least one listener must be defined on each server. The format
            of each listener defined in <code>listeners</code> is given below:</p>

        <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">{LISTENER_NAME}://{hostname}:{port}<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>

        <p>The <code>LISTENER_NAME</code> is usually a descriptive name which defines the purpose of
            the listener. For example, many configurations use a separate listener for client traffic,
            so they might refer to the corresponding listener as <code>CLIENT</code> in the configuration:</p><code class="language-text">listeners=CLIENT://localhost:9092</code>

        <p>The security protocol of each listener is defined in a separate configuration:
            <code>listener.security.protocol.map</code>. The value is a comma-separated list
            of each listener mapped to its security protocol. For example, the follow value
            configuration specifies that the <code>CLIENT</code> listener will use SSL while the
            <code>BROKER</code> listener will use plaintext.</p>

        <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">listener.security.protocol.map=CLIENT:SSL,BROKER:PLAINTEXT<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>

        <p>Possible options (case-insensitive) for the security protocol are given below:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>PLAINTEXT</li>
            <li>SSL</li>
            <li>SASL_PLAINTEXT</li>
            <li>SASL_SSL</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The plaintext protocol provides no security and does not require any additional configuration.
            In the following sections, this document covers how to configure the remaining protocols.</p>

        <p>If each required listener uses a separate security protocol, it is also possible to use the
            security protocol name as the listener name in <code>listeners</code>. Using the example above,
            we could skip the definition of the <code>CLIENT</code> and <code>BROKER</code> listeners
            using the following definition:</p>

        <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">listeners=SSL://localhost:9092,PLAINTEXT://localhost:9093<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>

        <p>However, we recommend users to provide explicit names for the listeners since it
            makes the intended usage of each listener clearer.</p>

        <p>Among the listeners in this list, it is possible to declare the listener to be used for
            inter-broker communication by setting the <code>inter.broker.listener.name</code> configuration
            to the name of the listener. The primary purpose of the inter-broker listener is
            partition replication. If not defined, then the inter-broker listener is determined
            by the security protocol defined by <code>security.inter.broker.protocol</code>, which
            defaults to <code>PLAINTEXT</code>.</p>

        <p>For legacy clusters which rely on Zookeeper to store cluster metadata, it is possible to
            declare a separate listener to be used for metadata propagation from the active controller
            to the brokers. This is defined by <code>control.plane.listener.name</code>. The active controller
            will use this listener when it needs to push metadata updates to the brokers in the cluster.
            The benefit of using a control plane listener is that it uses a separate processing thread,
            which makes it less likely for application traffic to impede timely propagation of metadata changes
            (such as partition leader and ISR updates). Note that the default value is null, which
            means that the controller will use the same listener defined by <code>inter.broker.listener</code></p>

        <p>In a KRaft cluster, a broker is any server which has the <code>broker</code> role enabled
            in <code>process.roles</code> and a controller is any server which has the <code>controller</code>
            role enabled. Listener configuration depends on the role. The listener defined by
            <code>inter.broker.listener.name</code> is used exclusively for requests between brokers.
            Controllers, on the other hand, must use separate listener which is defined by the
            <code>controller.listener.names</code> configuration. This cannot be set to the same
            value as the inter-broker listener.</p>

        <p>Controllers receive requests both from other controllers and from brokers. For
            this reason, even if a server does not have the <code>controller</code> role enabled
            (i.e. it is just a broker), it must still define the controller listener along with
            any security properties that are needed to configure it. For example, we might
            use the following configuration on a standalone broker:</p>

        <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">process.roles=broker
listeners=BROKER://localhost:9092
inter.broker.listener.name=BROKER
controller.quorum.voters=0@localhost:9093
controller.listener.names=CONTROLLER
listener.security.protocol.map=BROKER:SASL_SSL,CONTROLLER:SASL_SSL<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>

        <p>The controller listener is still configured in this example to use the <code>SASL_SSL</code>
            security protocol, but it is not included in <code>listeners</code> since the broker
            does not expose the controller listener itself. The port that will be used in this case
            comes from the <code>controller.quorum.voters</code> configuration, which defines
            the complete list of controllers.</p>

        <p>For KRaft servers which have both the broker and controller role enabled, the configuration
            is similar. The only difference is that the controller listener must be included in
            <code>listeners</code>:</p>

        <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">process.roles=broker,controller
listeners=BROKER://localhost:9092,CONTROLLER://localhost:9093
inter.broker.listener.name=BROKER
controller.quorum.voters=0@localhost:9093
controller.listener.names=CONTROLLER
listener.security.protocol.map=BROKER:SASL_SSL,CONTROLLER:SASL_SSL<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>

        <p>It is a requirement for the port defined in <code>controller.quorum.voters</code> to
            exactly match one of the exposed controller listeners. For example, here the
            <code>CONTROLLER</code> listener is bound to port 9093. The connection string
            defined by <code>controller.quorum.voters</code> must then also use port 9093,
            as it does here.</p>

        <p>The controller will accept requests on all listeners defined by <code>controller.listener.names</code>.
            Typically there would be just one controller listener, but it is possible to have more.
            For example, this provides a way to change the active listener from one port or security
            protocol to another through a roll of the cluster (one roll to expose the new listener,
            and one roll to remove the old listener). When multiple controller listeners are defined,
            the first one in the list will be used for outbound requests.</p>

        <p>It is conventional in Kafka to use a separate listener for clients. This allows the
            inter-cluster listeners to be isolated at the network level. In the case of the controller
            listener in KRaft, the listener should be isolated since clients do not work with it
            anyway. Clients are expected to connect to any other listener configured on a broker.
            Any requests that are bound for the controller will be forwarded as described
            <a href="#kraft_principal_forwarding">below</a></p>

        <p>In the following <a href="#security_ssl">section</a>, this document covers how to enable SSL
            on a listener for encryption as well as authentication. The subsequent <a href="#security_sasl">section</a> will then
            cover additional authentication mechanisms using SASL.</p>

        <h3 class="anchor-heading"><a id="security_ssl" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#security_ssl">7.3 Encryption and Authentication using SSL</a></h3>
        Apache Kafka allows clients to use SSL for encryption of traffic as well as authentication. By default, SSL is disabled but can be turned on if needed.
        The following paragraphs explain in detail how to set up your own PKI infrastructure, use it to create certificates and configure Kafka to use these.

        <ol>
            <li><h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="security_ssl_key" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#security_ssl_key">Generate SSL key and certificate for each Kafka broker</a></h4>
                The first step of deploying one or more brokers with SSL support is to generate a public/private keypair for every server.
                Since Kafka expects all keys and certificates to be stored in keystores we will use Java's keytool command for this task.
                The tool supports two different keystore formats, the Java specific jks format which has been deprecated by now, as well as PKCS12.
                PKCS12 is the default format as of Java version 9, to ensure this format is being used regardless of the Java version in use all following
                commands explicitly specify the PKCS12 format.
                <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> keytool -keystore <span class="token punctuation">{</span>keystorefile<span class="token punctuation">}</span> -alias localhost -validity <span class="token punctuation">{</span>validity<span class="token punctuation">}</span> -genkey -keyalg RSA -storetype pkcs12<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>
                You need to specify two parameters in the above command:
                <ol>
                    <li>keystorefile: the keystore file that stores the keys (and later the certificate) for this broker. The keystore file contains the private
                        and public keys of this broker, therefore it needs to be kept safe. Ideally this step is run on the Kafka broker that the key will be
                        used on, as this key should never be transmitted/leave the server that it is intended for.</li>
                    <li>validity: the valid time of the key in days. Please note that this differs from the validity period for the certificate, which
                        will be determined in <a href="#security_ssl_signing">Signing the certificate</a>. You can use the same key to request multiple
                        certificates: if your key has a validity of 10 years, but your CA will only sign certificates that are valid for one year, you
                        can use the same key with 10 certificates over time.</li>
                </ol><br>
                To obtain a certificate that can be used with the private key that was just created a certificate signing request needs to be created. This
                signing request, when signed by a trusted CA results in the actual certificate which can then be installed in the keystore and used for
                authentication purposes.<br>
                To generate certificate signing requests run the following command for all server keystores created so far.

                <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> keytool -keystore server.keystore.jks -alias localhost -validity <span class="token punctuation">{</span>validity<span class="token punctuation">}</span> -genkey -keyalg RSA -destkeystoretype pkcs12 -ext <span class="token assign-left variable">SAN</span><span class="token operator">=</span>DNS:<span class="token punctuation">{</span>FQDN<span class="token punctuation">}</span>,IP:<span class="token punctuation">{</span>IPADDRESS1<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>
                This command assumes that you want to add hostname information to the certificate, if this is not the case, you can omit the extension parameter <code>-ext SAN=DNS:{FQDN},IP:{IPADDRESS1}</code>. Please see below for more information on this.

                <h5>Host Name Verification</h5>
                Host name verification, when enabled, is the process of checking attributes from the certificate that is presented by the server you are
                connecting to against the actual hostname or ip address of that server to ensure that you are indeed connecting to the correct server.<br>
                The main reason for this check is to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

                For Kafka, this check has been disabled by default for a long time, but as of Kafka 2.0.0 host name verification of servers is enabled by default
                for client connections as well as inter-broker connections.<br>
                Server host name verification may be disabled by setting <code>ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm</code> to an empty string.<br>
                For dynamically configured broker listeners, hostname verification may be disabled using <code>kafka-configs.sh</code>:<br>

                <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> bin/kafka-configs.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9093 --entity-type brokers --entity-name <span class="token number">0</span> --alter --add-config <span class="token string">"listener.name.internal.ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm="</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>

                <p><b>Note:</b></p>
                Normally there is no good reason to disable hostname verification apart from being the quickest way to "just get it to work" followed
                by the promise to "fix it later when there is more time"!<br>
                Getting hostname verification right is not that hard when done at the right time, but gets much harder once the cluster is up and
                running - do yourself a favor and do it now!


                <p>If host name verification is enabled, clients will verify the server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or ip address against one of the following two fields:
                </p><ol>
                    <li>Common Name (CN)</li>
                    <li><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.6">Subject Alternative Name (SAN)</a></li>
                </ol><br>
                While Kafka checks both fields, usage of the common name field for hostname verification has been
                <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2818#section-3.1">deprecated</a> since 2000 and should be avoided if possible. In addition the
                SAN field is much more flexible, allowing for multiple DNS and IP entries to be declared in a certificate.<br>
                Another advantage is that if the SAN field is used for hostname verification the common name can be set to a more meaningful value for
                authorization purposes. Since we need the SAN field to be contained in the signed certificate, it will be specified when generating the
                signing request. It can also be specified when generating the keypair, but this will not automatically be copied into the signing request.<br>


                To add a SAN field append the following argument <code> -ext SAN=DNS:{FQDN},IP:{IPADDRESS}</code> to the keytool command:
                <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> keytool -keystore server.keystore.jks -alias localhost -validity <span class="token punctuation">{</span>validity<span class="token punctuation">}</span> -genkey -keyalg RSA -destkeystoretype pkcs12 -ext <span class="token assign-left variable">SAN</span><span class="token operator">=</span>DNS:<span class="token punctuation">{</span>FQDN<span class="token punctuation">}</span>,IP:<span class="token punctuation">{</span>IPADDRESS1<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>
            </li>

            <li><h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="security_ssl_ca" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#security_ssl_ca">Creating your own CA</a></h4>
                After this step each machine in the cluster has a public/private key pair which can already be used to encrypt traffic and a certificate
                signing request, which is the basis for creating a certificate. To add authentication capabilities this signing request needs to be signed
                by a trusted authority, which will be created in this step.

                <p>A certificate authority (CA) is responsible for signing certificates. CAs works likes a government that issues passports - the government
                    stamps (signs) each passport so that the passport becomes difficult to forge. Other governments verify the stamps to ensure the passport is
                    authentic. Similarly, the CA signs the certificates, and the cryptography guarantees that a signed certificate is computationally difficult to
                    forge. Thus, as long as the CA is a genuine and trusted authority, the clients have a strong assurance that they are connecting to the authentic
                    machines.

                </p><p>For this guide we will be our own Certificate Authority. When setting up a production cluster in a corporate environment these certificates would
                    usually be signed by a corporate CA that is trusted throughout the company. Please see <a href="#security_ssl_production">Common Pitfalls in
                        Production</a> for some things to consider for this case.

                </p><p>Due to a <a href="https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man1/x509.html#BUGS">bug</a> in OpenSSL, the x509 module will not copy requested
                    extension fields from CSRs into the final certificate. Since we want the SAN extension to be present in our certificate to enable hostname
                    verification, we'll use the <i>ca</i> module instead. This requires some additional configuration to be in place before we generate our
                    CA keypair.<br>

                Then create a database and serial number file, these will be used to keep track of which certificates were signed with this CA. Both of
                these are simply text files that reside in the same directory as your CA keys.

                <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token builtin class-name">echo</span> 01 <span class="token operator">&gt;</span> serial.txt
<span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token function">touch</span> index.txt<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>

                With these steps done you are now ready to generate your CA that will be used to sign certificates later.

                <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> openssl req -x509 -config openssl-ca.cnf -newkey rsa:4096 -sha256 -nodes -out cacert.pem -outform PEM<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>

                The CA is simply a public/private key pair and certificate that is signed by itself, and is only intended to sign other certificates.<br>
                This keypair should be kept very safe, if someone gains access to it, they can create and sign certificates that will be trusted by your
                infrastructure, which means they will be able to impersonate anybody when connecting to any service that trusts this CA.<br>

                The next step is to add the generated CA to the **clients' truststore** so that the clients can trust this CA:
                <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> keytool -keystore client.truststore.jks -alias CARoot -import -file ca-cert<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>

                <b>Note:</b>
                If you configure the Kafka brokers to require client authentication by setting ssl.client.auth to be "requested" or "required" in the
                <a href="#brokerconfigs">Kafka brokers config</a> then you must provide a truststore for the Kafka brokers as well and it should have
                all the CA certificates that clients' keys were signed by.
                <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> keytool -keystore server.truststore.jks -alias CARoot -import -file ca-cert<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>

                In contrast to the keystore in step 1 that stores each machine's own identity, the truststore of a client stores all the certificates
                that the client should trust. Importing a certificate into one's truststore also means trusting all certificates that are signed by that
                certificate. As the analogy above, trusting the government (CA) also means trusting all passports (certificates) that it has issued. This
                attribute is called the chain of trust, and it is particularly useful when deploying SSL on a large Kafka cluster. You can sign all certificates
                in the cluster with a single CA, and have all machines share the same truststore that trusts the CA. That way all machines can authenticate all
                other machines.
            </li>
            <li><h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="security_ssl_signing" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#security_ssl_signing">Signing the certificate</a></h4>
                Then sign it with the CA:
                <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> openssl ca -config openssl-ca.cnf -policy signing_policy -extensions signing_req -out <span class="token punctuation">{</span>server certificate<span class="token punctuation">}</span> -infiles <span class="token punctuation">{</span>certificate signing request<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>

                Finally, you need to import both the certificate of the CA and the signed certificate into the keystore:
                <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> keytool -keystore <span class="token punctuation">{</span>keystore<span class="token punctuation">}</span> -alias CARoot -import -file <span class="token punctuation">{</span>CA certificate<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
<span class="token operator">&gt;</span> keytool -keystore <span class="token punctuation">{</span>keystore<span class="token punctuation">}</span> -alias localhost -import -file cert-signed<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>

                The definitions of the parameters are the following:
                <ol>
                    <li>keystore: the location of the keystore</li>
                    <li>CA certificate: the certificate of the CA</li>
                    <li>certificate signing request: the csr created with the server key</li>
                    <li>server certificate: the file to write the signed certificate of the server to</li>
                </ol>

                This will leave you with one truststore called <i>truststore.jks</i> - this can be the same for all clients and brokers and does not
                contain any sensitive information, so there is no need to secure this.<br>
                Additionally you will have one <i>server.keystore.jks</i> file per node which contains that nodes keys, certificate and your CAs certificate,
                please refer to <a href="#security_configbroker">Configuring Kafka Brokers</a> and <a href="#security_configclients">Configuring Kafka Clients</a>
                for information on how to use these files.

                <p>For some tooling assistance on this topic, please check out the <a href="https://github.com/OpenVPN/easy-rsa">easyRSA</a> project which has
                    extensive scripting in place to help with these steps.</p>

                <h5>SSL key and certificates in PEM format</h5>
                From 2.7.0 onwards, SSL key and trust stores can be configured for Kafka brokers and clients directly in the configuration in PEM format.
                This avoids the need to store separate files on the file system and benefits from password protection features of Kafka configuration.
                PEM may also be used as the store type for file-based key and trust stores in addition to JKS and PKCS12. To configure PEM key store directly in the
                broker or client configuration, private key in PEM format should be provided in <code>ssl.keystore.key</code> and the certificate chain in PEM format
                should be provided in <code>ssl.keystore.certificate.chain</code>.  To configure trust store, trust certificates, e.g. public certificate of CA,
                should be provided in <code>ssl.truststore.certificates</code>. Since PEM is typically stored as multi-line base-64 strings, the configuration value
                can be included in Kafka configuration as multi-line strings with lines terminating in backslash ('\') for line continuation.

                <p>Store password configs <code>ssl.keystore.password</code> and <code>ssl.truststore.password</code> are not used for PEM.
                    If private key is encrypted using a password, the key password must be provided in <code>ssl.key.password</code>. Private keys may be provided
                    in unencrypted form without a password. In production deployments, configs should be encrypted or
                    externalized using password protection feature in Kafka in this case. Note that the default SSL engine factory has limited capabilities for decryption
                    of encrypted private keys when external tools like OpenSSL are used for encryption. Third party libraries like BouncyCastle may be integrated with a
                    custom <code>SslEngineFactory</code> to support a wider range of encrypted private keys.</p>

            <li><h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="security_ssl_production" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#security_ssl_production">Common Pitfalls in Production</a></h4>
                The above paragraphs show the process to create your own CA and use it to sign certificates for your cluster.
                While very useful for sandbox, dev, test, and similar systems, this is usually not the correct process to create certificates for a production
                cluster in a corporate environment.
                Enterprises will normally operate their own CA and users can send in CSRs to be signed with this CA, which has the benefit of users not being
                responsible to keep the CA secure as well as a central authority that everybody can trust.
                However it also takes away a lot of control over the process of signing certificates from the user. Quite often the persons operating corporate
                CAs will apply tight restrictions on certificates that can cause issues when trying to use these certificates with Kafka.

                <ol>
                    <li><b><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.12">Extended Key Usage</a></b><br>Certificates may contain an extension
                        field that controls the purpose for which the certificate can be used. If this field is empty, there are no restrictions on the usage,
                        but if any usage is specified in here, valid SSL implementations have to enforce these usages.<br>
                        Relevant usages for Kafka are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Client authentication</li>
                            <li>Server authentication</li>
                        </ul>
                        Kafka brokers need both these usages to be allowed, as for intra-cluster communication every broker will behave as both the client and
                        the server towards other brokers. It is not uncommon for corporate CAs to have a signing profile for webservers and use this for Kafka as
                        well, which will only contain the <i>serverAuth</i> usage value and cause the SSL handshake to fail.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Intermediate Certificates</b><br>
                        Corporate Root CAs are often kept offline for security reasons. To enable day-to-day usage, so called intermediate CAs are created, which
                        are then used to sign the final certificates. When importing a certificate into the keystore that was signed by an intermediate CA it is
                        necessary to provide the entire chain of trust up to the root CA. This can be done by simply <i>cat</i>ing the certificate files into one
                        combined certificate file and then importing this with keytool.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Failure to copy extension fields</b><br>
                        CA operators are often hesitant to copy and requested extension fields from CSRs and prefer to specify these themselves as this makes it
                        harder for a malicious party to obtain certificates with potentially misleading or fraudulent values.
                        It is advisable to double check signed certificates, whether these contain all requested SAN fields to enable proper hostname verification.
                        The following command can be used to print certificate details to the console, which should be compared with what was originally requested:
                        <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> openssl x509 -in certificate.crt -text -noout<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>

            <li><h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="security_configbroker" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#security_configbroker">Configuring Kafka Brokers</a></h4>

                If SSL is not enabled for inter-broker communication (see below for how to enable it), both PLAINTEXT and SSL ports will be necessary.
                <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">listeners=PLAINTEXT://host.name:port,SSL://host.name:port<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>

                Following SSL configs are needed on the broker side
                <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">ssl.keystore.location=/var/private/ssl/server.keystore.jks
ssl.keystore.password=test1234
ssl.key.password=test1234
ssl.truststore.location=/var/private/ssl/server.truststore.jks
ssl.truststore.password=test1234<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>

                Note: ssl.truststore.password is technically optional but highly recommended. If a password is not set access to the truststore is still available, but integrity checking is disabled.

                Optional settings that are worth considering:
                <ol>
                    <li>ssl.client.auth=none ("required" =&gt; client authentication is required, "requested" =&gt; client authentication is requested and client without certs can still connect. The usage of "requested" is discouraged as it provides a false sense of security and misconfigured clients will still connect successfully.)</li>
                    <li>ssl.cipher.suites (Optional). A cipher suite is a named combination of authentication, encryption, MAC and key exchange algorithm used to negotiate the security settings for a network connection using TLS or SSL network protocol. (Default is an empty list)</li>
                    <li>ssl.enabled.protocols=TLSv1.2,TLSv1.1,TLSv1 (list out the SSL protocols that you are going to accept from clients. Do note that SSL is deprecated in favor of TLS and using SSL in production is not recommended)</li>
                    <li>ssl.keystore.type=JKS</li>
                    <li>ssl.truststore.type=JKS</li>
                    <li>ssl.secure.random.implementation=SHA1PRNG</li>
                </ol>
                If you want to enable SSL for inter-broker communication, add the following to the server.properties file (it defaults to PLAINTEXT)
                <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">security.inter.broker.protocol=SSL<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>

                <p>
                    Due to import regulations in some countries, the Oracle implementation limits the strength of cryptographic algorithms available by default. If stronger algorithms are needed (for example, AES with 256-bit keys), the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">JCE Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files</a> must be obtained and installed in the JDK/JRE. See the
                    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/SunProviders.html">JCA Providers Documentation</a> for more information.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The JRE/JDK will have a default pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) that is used for cryptography operations, so it is not required to configure the
                    implementation used with the <code>ssl.secure.random.implementation</code>. However, there are performance issues with some implementations (notably, the
                    default chosen on Linux systems, <code>NativePRNG</code>, utilizes a global lock). In cases where performance of SSL connections becomes an issue,
                    consider explicitly setting the implementation to be used. The <code>SHA1PRNG</code> implementation is non-blocking, and has shown very good performance
                    characteristics under heavy load (50 MB/sec of produced messages, plus replication traffic, per-broker).
                </p>

                Once you start the broker you should be able to see in the server.log
                <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">with addresses: PLAINTEXT -&gt; EndPoint(192.168.64.1,9092,PLAINTEXT),SSL -&gt; EndPoint(192.168.64.1,9093,SSL)<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>

                To check quickly if  the server keystore and truststore are setup properly you can run the following command
                <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> openssl s_client -debug -connect localhost:9093 -tls1<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre> (Note: TLSv1 should be listed under ssl.enabled.protocols)<br>
                In the output of this command you should see server's certificate:
                <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----

                If the certificate does not show up or if there are any other error messages then your keystore is not setup properly.</li>

                SSL is supported only for the new Kafka Producer and Consumer, the older API is not supported. The configs for SSL will be the same for both producer and consumer.<br>
                If client authentication is not required in the broker, then the following is a minimal configuration example:
                <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">security.protocol=SSL
ssl.truststore.location=/var/private/ssl/client.truststore.jks
ssl.truststore.password=test1234<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>

                Note: ssl.truststore.password is technically optional but highly recommended. If a password is not set access to the truststore is still available, but integrity checking is disabled.

                If client authentication is required, then a keystore must be created like in step 1 and the following must also be configured:
                <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">ssl.keystore.location=/var/private/ssl/client.keystore.jks
ssl.keystore.password=test1234
ssl.key.password=test1234<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>

                Other configuration settings that may also be needed depending on our requirements and the broker configuration:
                <ol>
                    <li>ssl.provider (Optional). The name of the security provider used for SSL connections. Default value is the default security provider of the JVM.</li>
                    <li>ssl.cipher.suites (Optional). A cipher suite is a named combination of authentication, encryption, MAC and key exchange algorithm used to negotiate the security settings for a network connection using TLS or SSL network protocol.</li>
                    <li>ssl.enabled.protocols=TLSv1.2,TLSv1.1,TLSv1. It should list at least one of the protocols configured on the broker side</li>
                    <li>ssl.truststore.type=JKS</li>
                    <li>ssl.keystore.type=JKS</li>

                    (<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/jaas/JAASRefGuide.html">JAAS</a>)

                    <li><h5><a id="security_jaas_broker" href="#security_jaas_broker">JAAS configuration for Kafka brokers</a></h5>

                        <p><tt>KafkaServer</tt> is the section name in the JAAS file used by each
                            KafkaServer/Broker. This section provides SASL configuration options
                            for the broker including any SASL client connections made by the broker
                            for inter-broker communication. If multiple listeners are configured to use
                            SASL, the section name may be prefixed with the listener name in lower-case
                            followed by a period, e.g. <tt>sasl_ssl.KafkaServer</tt>.</p>

                        <p><tt>Client</tt> section is used to authenticate a SASL connection with
                            zookeeper. It also allows the brokers to set SASL ACL on zookeeper
                            nodes which locks these nodes down so that only the brokers can
                            modify it. It is necessary to have the same principal name across all
                            brokers. If you want to use a section name other than Client, set the
                            system property <tt>zookeeper.sasl.clientconfig</tt> to the appropriate
                            name (<i>e.g.</i>, <tt>-Dzookeeper.sasl.clientconfig=ZkClient</tt>).</p>

                        <p>ZooKeeper uses "zookeeper" as the service name by default. If you
                            want to change this, set the system property
                            <tt>zookeeper.sasl.client.username</tt> to the appropriate name
                            (<i>e.g.</i>, <tt>-Dzookeeper.sasl.client.username=zk</tt>).</p>

                        <p>Brokers may also configure JAAS using the broker configuration property <code>sasl.jaas.config</code>.
                            The property name must be prefixed with the listener prefix including the SASL mechanism,
                            i.e. <code>listener.name.{listenerName}.{saslMechanism}.sasl.jaas.config</code>. Only one
                            login module may be specified in the config value. If multiple mechanisms are configured on a
                            listener, configs must be provided for each mechanism using the listener and mechanism prefix.
                            For example,</p>
                        <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">listener.name.sasl_ssl.scram-sha-256.sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.scram.ScramLoginModule required \

                        If JAAS configuration is defined at different levels, the order of precedence used is:

                        Note that ZooKeeper JAAS config may only be configured using static JAAS configuration.

                            <li><b>Kerberos</b><br>
                                If your organization is already using a Kerberos server (for example, by using Active Directory), there is no need to install a new server just for Kafka. Otherwise you will need to install one, your Linux vendor likely has packages for Kerberos and a short guide on how to install and configure it (<a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kerberos">Ubuntu</a>, <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Managing_Smart_Cards/installing-kerberos.html">Redhat</a>). Note that if you are using Oracle Java, you will need to download JCE policy files for your Java version and copy them to $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security.</li>
                            <li><b>Create Kerberos Principals</b><br>
                                If you are using the organization's Kerberos or Active Directory server, ask your Kerberos administrator for a principal for each Kafka broker in your cluster and for every operating system user that will access Kafka with Kerberos authentication (via clients and tools).<br>
                                If you have installed your own Kerberos, you will need to create these principals yourself using the following commands:
                                <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token function">sudo</span> /usr/sbin/kadmin.local -q <span class="token string">'addprinc -randkey kafka/{hostname}@{REALM}'</span>

                            <li><b>Make sure all hosts can be reachable using hostnames</b> - it is a Kerberos requirement that all your hosts can be resolved with their FQDNs.</li>

                            <tt>KafkaServer</tt> section in the JAAS file tells the broker which principal to use and the location of the keytab where this principal is stored. It
                            allows the broker to login using the keytab specified in this section. See <a href="#security_jaas_broker">notes</a> for more details on Zookeeper SASL configuration.
                        </li>
                        <li>Pass the JAAS and optionally the krb5 file locations as JVM parameters to each Kafka broker (see <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/jgss/tutorials/KerberosReq.html">here</a> for more details):

                        <li>Configure SASL port and SASL mechanisms in server.properties as described <a href="#security_sasl_brokerconfig">here</a>. For example:

                            We must also configure the service name in server.properties, which should match the principal name of the kafka brokers. In the above example, principal is "kafka/kafka1.hostname.com@EXAMPLE.com", so:

                            <li>
                                Clients (producers, consumers, connect workers, etc) will authenticate to the cluster with their
                                own principal (usually with the same name as the user running the client), so obtain or create
                                these principals as needed. Then configure the JAAS configuration property for each client.
                                Different clients within a JVM may run as different users by specifying different principals.
                                The property <code>sasl.jaas.config</code> in producer.properties or consumer.properties describes
                                how clients like producer and consumer can connect to the Kafka Broker. The following is an example
                                configuration for a client using a keytab (recommended for long-running processes):

                                For command-line utilities like kafka-console-consumer or kafka-console-producer, kinit can be used
                                along with "useTicketCache=true" as in:

                <p>SASL/PLAIN is a simple username/password authentication mechanism that is typically used with TLS for encryption to implement secure authentication.
                    Kafka supports a default implementation for SASL/PLAIN which can be extended for production use as described <a href="#security_sasl_plain_production">here</a>.</p>
                Under the default implementation of <code>principal.builder.class</code>, the username is used as the authenticated <code>Principal</code> for configuration of ACLs etc.

                <p>Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) is a family of SASL mechanisms that
                    addresses the security concerns with traditional mechanisms that perform username/password authentication
                    like PLAIN and DIGEST-MD5. The mechanism is defined in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5802">RFC 5802</a>.
                    Kafka supports <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7677">SCRAM-SHA-256</a> and SCRAM-SHA-512 which
                    can be used with TLS to perform secure authentication. Under the default implementation of <code>principal.builder.class</code>, the username is used as the authenticated
                    <code>Principal</code> for configuration of ACLs etc. The default SCRAM implementation in Kafka
                    stores SCRAM credentials in Zookeeper and is suitable for use in Kafka installations where Zookeeper
                    is on a private network. Refer to <a href="#security_sasl_scram_security">Security Considerations</a>

                            <li>The default implementation of SASL/SCRAM in Kafka stores SCRAM credentials in Zookeeper. This
                                is suitable for production use in installations where Zookeeper is secure and on a private network.</li>
                            <li>Kafka supports only the strong hash functions SHA-256 and SHA-512 with a minimum iteration count
                                of 4096. Strong hash functions combined with strong passwords and high iteration counts protect
                                against brute force attacks if Zookeeper security is compromised.</li>
                            <li>SCRAM should be used only with TLS-encryption to prevent interception of SCRAM exchanges. This
                                protects against dictionary or brute force attacks and against impersonation if Zookeeper is compromised.</li>
                            <li>From Kafka version 2.0 onwards, the default SASL/SCRAM credential store may be overridden using custom callback handlers
                                by configuring <code>sasl.server.callback.handler.class</code> in installations where Zookeeper is not secure.</li>

            <li><h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="security_delegation_token" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#security_delegation_token">Authentication using Delegation Tokens</a></h4>
                <p>Delegation token based authentication is a lightweight authentication mechanism to complement existing SASL/SSL
                    methods. Delegation tokens are shared secrets between kafka brokers and clients. Delegation tokens will help processing
                    frameworks to distribute the workload to available workers in a secure environment without the added cost of distributing
                    Kerberos TGT/keytabs or keystores when 2-way SSL is used. See <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-48+Delegation+token+support+for+Kafka">KIP-48</a>
                    for more details.</p>
                Under the default implementation of <code>principal.builder.class</code>, the owner of delegation token is used as the authenticated <code>Principal</code> for configuration of ACLs etc.

                <p>Typical steps for delegation token usage are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>User authenticates with the Kafka cluster via SASL or SSL, and obtains a delegation token. This can be done
                        using Admin APIs or using <tt>kafka-delegation-tokens.sh</tt> script.</li>
                    <li>User securely passes the delegation token to Kafka clients for authenticating with the Kafka cluster.</li>
                    <li>Token owner/renewer can renew/expire the delegation tokens.</li>
                </ol>

                <ol>
                    <li><h5 class="anchor-heading"><a id="security_token_management" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#security_token_management">Token Management</a></h5>
                        <p> A secret is used to generate and verify delegation tokens. This is supplied using config
                            option <tt>delegation.token.secret.key</tt>. The same secret key must be configured across all the brokers.
                            If using Kafka with KRaft the controllers must also be configured with the secret using the same config option.
                            If the secret is not set or set to empty string, delegation token authentication and API operations will fail.</p>

                        <p>When using Kafka with Zookeeper, the token details are stored in Zookeeper and delegation tokens are suitable
                            for use in Kafka installations where Zookeeper is on a private network. When using Kafka with KRaft, the token
                            details are stored with the other metadata on the controller nodes and delegation tokens are suitable for use
                            when the controllers are on a private network or when all commnications between brokers and controllers is
                            encrypted.  Currently, this secret is stored as plain text in the server.properties config file.
                            We intend to make these configurable in a future Kafka release.</p>

                        <p>A token has a current life, and a maximum renewable life. By default, tokens must be renewed once every 24 hours
                            for up to 7 days. These can be configured using <tt>delegation.token.expiry.time.ms</tt>
                            and <tt>delegation.token.max.lifetime.ms</tt> config options.</p>

                        <p>Tokens can also be cancelled explicitly.  If a token is not renewed by the token’s expiration time or if token
                            is beyond the max life time, it will be deleted from all broker caches as well as from zookeeper.</p>

                        <p>Tokens can be created by using Admin APIs or using <tt>kafka-delegation-tokens.sh</tt> script.
                            Delegation token requests (create/renew/expire/describe) should be issued only on SASL or SSL authenticated channels.
                            Tokens can not be requests if the initial authentication is done through delegation token.
                            A token can be created by the user for that user or others as well by specifying the <tt>--owner-principal</tt> parameter.
                            Owner/Renewers can renew or expire tokens. Owner/renewers can always describe their own tokens.
                            To describe other tokens, a DESCRIBE_TOKEN permission needs to be added on the User resource representing the owner of the token.

                                The login module describes how the clients like producer and consumer can connect to the Kafka Broker.
                                The following is an example configuration for a client for the token authentication:

                                <p>The options <tt>username</tt> and <tt>password</tt> are used by clients to configure the token id and

                                    In this example, clients connect to the broker using token id: <i>tokenID123</i>. Different clients within a

        <h3 class="anchor-heading"><a id="security_authz" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#security_authz">7.5 Authorization and ACLs</a></h3>
        Kafka ships with a pluggable authorization framework, which is configured with the <tt>authorizer.class.name</tt> property in the server configuration.
        Configured implementations must extend <code>org.apache.kafka.server.authorizer.Authorizer</code>.
        Kafka provides default implementations which store ACLs in the cluster metadata (either Zookeeper or the KRaft metadata log).

        For Zookeeper-based clusters, the provided implementation is configured as follows:
        <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">authorizer.class.name=kafka.security.authorizer.AclAuthorizer<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>
        For KRaft clusters, use the following configuration on all nodes (brokers, controllers, or combined broker/controller nodes):
        <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">authorizer.class.name=org.apache.kafka.metadata.authorizer.StandardAuthorizer<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>

        Kafka ACLs are defined in the general format of "Principal {P} is [Allowed|Denied] Operation {O} From Host {H} on any Resource {R} matching ResourcePattern {RP}".
        You can read more about the ACL structure in <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-11+-+Authorization+Interface">KIP-11</a> and
        resource patterns in <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-290%3A+Support+for+Prefixed+ACLs">KIP-290</a>.
        In order to add, remove, or list ACLs, you can use the Kafka ACL CLI <code>kafka-acls.sh</code>. By default, if no ResourcePatterns match a specific Resource R,
        then R has no associated ACLs, and therefore no one other than super users is allowed to access R.
        If you want to change that behavior, you can include the following in server.properties.
        <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">allow.everyone.if.no.acl.found=true<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>
        One can also add super users in server.properties like the following (note that the delimiter is semicolon since SSL user names may contain comma). Default PrincipalType string "User" is case sensitive.
        <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">super.users=User:Bob;User:Alice<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>

        <h5 class="anchor-heading"><a id="kraft_principal_forwarding" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#kraft_principal_forwarding">KRaft Principal Forwarding</a></h5>

        In KRaft clusters, admin requests such as <code>CreateTopics</code> and <code>DeleteTopics</code> are sent to the broker listeners by the client. The broker then forwards the request to the active controller through the first listener configured in <code>controller.listener.names</code>.
        Authorization of these requests is done on the controller node. This is achieved by way of an <code>Envelope</code> request which packages both the underlying request from the client as well as the client principal.
        When the controller receives the forwarded <code>Envelope</code> request from the broker, it first authorizes the <code>Envelope</code> request using the authenticated broker principal.
        Then it authorizes the underlying request using the forwarded principal.

        <br>All of this implies that Kafka must understand how to serialize and deserialize the client principal. The authentication framework allows for customized principals by overriding the <code>principal.builder.class</code> configuration.
        In order for customized principals to work with KRaft, the configured class must implement <code>org.apache.kafka.common.security.auth.KafkaPrincipalSerde</code> so that Kafka knows how to serialize and deserialize the principals.
        The default implementation <code>org.apache.kafka.common.security.authenticator.DefaultKafkaPrincipalBuilder</code> uses the Kafka RPC format defined in the source code: <code>clients/src/main/resources/common/message/DefaultPrincipalData.json</code>.

        For more detail about request forwarding in KRaft, see <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-590%3A+Redirect+Zookeeper+Mutation+Protocols+to+The+Controller">KIP-590</a>

        <h5 class="anchor-heading"><a id="security_authz_ssl" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#security_authz_ssl">Customizing SSL User Name</a></h5>

        By default, the SSL user name will be of the form "CN=writeuser,OU=Unknown,O=Unknown,L=Unknown,ST=Unknown,C=Unknown". One can change that by setting <code>ssl.principal.mapping.rules</code> to a customized rule in server.properties.
        This config allows a list of rules for mapping X.500 distinguished name to short name. The rules are evaluated in order and the first rule that matches a distinguished name is used to map it to a short name. Any later rules in the list are ignored.

        <br>The format of <code>ssl.principal.mapping.rules</code> is a list where each rule starts with "RULE:" and contains an expression as the following formats. Default rule will return
        string representation of the X.500 certificate distinguished name. If the distinguished name matches the pattern, then the replacement command will be run over the name.
        This also supports lowercase/uppercase options, to force the translated result to be all lower/uppercase case. This is done by adding a "/L" or "/U' to the end of the rule.

        By default, the SASL user name will be the primary part of the Kerberos principal. One can change that by setting <code>sasl.kerberos.principal.to.local.rules</code> to a customized rule in server.properties.
        The format of <code>sasl.kerberos.principal.to.local.rules</code> is a list where each rule works in the same way as the auth_to_local in <a href="http://web.mit.edu/Kerberos/krb5-latest/doc/admin/conf_files/krb5_conf.html">Kerberos configuration file (krb5.conf)</a>. This also support additional lowercase/uppercase rule, to force the translated result to be all lowercase/uppercase. This is done by adding a "/L" or "/U" to the end of the rule. check below formats for syntax.
        Each rules starts with RULE: and contains an expression as the following formats. See the kerberos documentation for more details.

        <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="security_authz_cli" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#security_authz_cli">Command Line Interface</a></h4>
        Kafka Authorization management CLI can be found under bin directory with all the other CLIs. The CLI script is called <b>kafka-acls.sh</b>. Following lists all the options that the script supports:
        <p></p>
        <p>..........</p>

        <h4 class="anchor-heading"><a id="security_authz_examples" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#security_authz_examples">Examples</a></h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Adding Acls</b><br>
                Suppose you want to add an acl "Principals User:Bob and User:Alice are allowed to perform Operation Read and Write on Topic Test-Topic from IP 198.51.100.0 and IP 198.51.100.1". You can do that by executing the CLI with following options:
                <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> bin/kafka-acls.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --add --allow-principal User:Bob --allow-principal User:Alice --allow-host <span class="token number">198.51</span>.100.0 --allow-host <span class="token number">198.51</span>.100.1 --operation Read --operation Write --topic Test-topic<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>
                By default, all principals that don't have an explicit acl that allows access for an operation to a resource are denied. In rare cases where an allow acl is defined that allows access to all but some principal we will have to use the --deny-principal and --deny-host option. For example, if we want to allow all users to Read from Test-topic but only deny User:BadBob from IP 198.51.100.3 we can do so using following commands:
                <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> bin/kafka-acls.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --add --allow-principal User:<span class="token string">'*'</span> --allow-host <span class="token string">'*'</span> --deny-principal User:BadBob --deny-host <span class="token number">198.51</span>.100.3 --operation Read --topic Test-topic<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>
                Note that <code>--allow-host</code> and <code>--deny-host</code> only support IP addresses (hostnames are not supported).
                Above examples add acls to a topic by specifying --topic [topic-name] as the resource pattern option. Similarly user can add acls to cluster by specifying --cluster and to a consumer group by specifying --group [group-name].
                You can add acls on any resource of a certain type, e.g. suppose you wanted to add an acl "Principal User:Peter is allowed to produce to any Topic from IP 198.51.200.0"
                You can do that by using the wildcard resource '*', e.g. by executing the CLI with following options:
                <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> bin/kafka-acls.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --add --allow-principal User:Peter --allow-host <span class="token number">198.51</span>.200.1 --producer --topic <span class="token string">'*'</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>
                You can add acls on prefixed resource patterns, e.g. suppose you want to add an acl "Principal User:Jane is allowed to produce to any Topic whose name starts with 'Test-' from any host".
                You can do that by executing the CLI with following options:
                <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> bin/kafka-acls.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --add --allow-principal User:Jane --producer --topic Test- --resource-pattern-type prefixed<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>
                Note, --resource-pattern-type defaults to 'literal', which only affects resources with the exact same name or, in the case of the wildcard resource name '*', a resource with any name.</li>

            <li><b>Removing Acls</b><br>
                Removing acls is pretty much the same. The only difference is instead of --add option users will have to specify --remove option. To remove the acls added by the first example above we can execute the CLI with following options:
                <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> bin/kafka-acls.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --remove --allow-principal User:Bob --allow-principal User:Alice --allow-host <span class="token number">198.51</span>.100.0 --allow-host <span class="token number">198.51</span>.100.1 --operation Read --operation Write --topic Test-topic <span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>
                If you want to remove the acl added to the prefixed resource pattern above we can execute the CLI with following options:
                <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> bin/kafka-acls.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --remove --allow-principal User:Jane --producer --topic Test- --resource-pattern-type Prefixed<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre></li>

            <li><b>List Acls</b><br>
                We can list acls for any resource by specifying the --list option with the resource. To list all acls on the literal resource pattern Test-topic, we can execute the CLI with following options:
                <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> bin/kafka-acls.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --list --topic Test-topic<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>
                However, this will only return the acls that have been added to this exact resource pattern. Other acls can exist that affect access to the topic,
                e.g. any acls on the topic wildcard '*', or any acls on prefixed resource patterns. Acls on the wildcard resource pattern can be queried explicitly:
                <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> bin/kafka-acls.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --list --topic <span class="token string">'*'</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>
                However, it is not necessarily possible to explicitly query for acls on prefixed resource patterns that match Test-topic as the name of such patterns may not be known.
                We can list <i>all</i> acls affecting Test-topic by using '--resource-pattern-type match', e.g.
                <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> bin/kafka-acls.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --list --topic Test-topic --resource-pattern-type match<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>
                This will list acls on all matching literal, wildcard and prefixed resource patterns.</li>

            <li><b>Adding or removing a principal as producer or consumer</b><br>
                The most common use case for acl management are adding/removing a principal as producer or consumer so we added convenience options to handle these cases. In order to add User:Bob as a producer of  Test-topic we can execute the following command:
                <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> bin/kafka-acls.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --add --allow-principal User:Bob --producer --topic Test-topic<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>
                Similarly to add Alice as a consumer of Test-topic with consumer group Group-1 we just have to pass --consumer option:
                <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> bin/kafka-acls.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --add --allow-principal User:Bob --consumer --topic Test-topic --group Group-1 <span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>
                Note that for consumer option we must also specify the consumer group.
                In order to remove a principal from producer or consumer role we just need to pass --remove option. </li>

            <li><b>Admin API based acl management</b><br>
                Users having Alter permission on ClusterResource can use Admin API for ACL management. kafka-acls.sh script supports AdminClient API to manage ACLs without interacting with zookeeper/authorizer directly.
                All the above examples can be executed by using <b>--bootstrap-server</b> option. For example:

                <pre class="line-numbers language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash">bin/kafka-acls.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --command-config /tmp/adminclient-configs.conf --add --allow-principal User:Bob --producer --topic Test-topic
bin/kafka-acls.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --command-config /tmp/adminclient-configs.conf --add --allow-principal User:Bob --consumer --topic Test-topic --group Group-1
bin/kafka-acls.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --command-config /tmp/adminclient-configs.conf --list --topic Test-topic
bin/kafka-acls.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --command-config /tmp/adminclient-configs.conf --add --allow-principal User:tokenRequester --operation CreateTokens --user-principal <span class="token string">"owner1"</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre></li>

        </ul>

        <p>Protocol calls are usually performing some operations on certain resources in Kafka. It is required to know the
            operations and resources to set up effective protection. In this section we'll list these operations and
            resources, then list the combination of these with the protocols to see the valid scenarios.</p>
        <h5 class="anchor-heading"><a id="operations_in_kafka" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#operations_in_kafka">Operations in Kafka</a></h5>
        <p>There are a few operation primitives that can be used to build up privileges. These can be matched up with
            certain resources to allow specific protocol calls for a given user. These are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Read</li>
            <li>Write</li>
            <li>Create</li>

        <p>The operations above can be applied on certain resources which are described below.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Topic:</b> this simply represents a Topic. All protocol calls that are acting on topics (such as reading,
                writing them) require the corresponding privilege to be added. If there is an authorization error with a
                topic resource, then a TOPIC_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED (error code: 29) will be returned.</li>
            <li><b>Group:</b> this represents the consumer groups in the brokers. All protocol calls that are working with
                consumer groups, like joining a group must have privileges with the group in subject. If the privilege is not
                given then a GROUP_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED (error code: 30) will be returned in the protocol response.</li>
            <li><b>Cluster:</b> this resource represents the cluster. Operations that are affecting the whole cluster, like
                controlled shutdown are protected by privileges on the Cluster resource. If there is an authorization problem
                on a cluster resource, then a CLUSTER_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED (error code: 31) will be returned.</li>
            <li><b>TransactionalId:</b> this resource represents actions related to transactions, such as committing.
                If any error occurs, then a TRANSACTIONAL_ID_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED (error code: 53) will be returned by brokers.</li>
            <li><b>DelegationToken:</b> this represents the delegation tokens in the cluster. Actions, such as describing
                delegation tokens could be protected by a privilege on the DelegationToken resource. Since these objects have
                a little special behavior in Kafka it is recommended to read
                <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-48+Delegation+token+support+for+Kafka#KIP-48DelegationtokensupportforKafka-DescribeDelegationTokenRequest">KIP-48</a>

        You can secure a running cluster via one or more of the supported protocols discussed previously. This is done in phases:
        <p></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Incrementally bounce the cluster nodes to open additional secured port(s).</li>
            <li>Restart clients using the secured rather than PLAINTEXT port (assuming you are securing the client-broker connection).</li>
            <li>Incrementally bounce the cluster again to enable broker-to-broker security (if this is required)</li>
            <li>A final incremental bounce to close the PLAINTEXT port.</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        The specific steps for configuring SSL and SASL are described in sections <a href="#security_ssl">7.3</a> and <a href="#security_sasl">7.4</a>.
        Follow these steps to enable security for your desired protocol(s).
        <p></p>
        The security implementation lets you configure different protocols for both broker-client and broker-broker communication.
        These must be enabled in separate bounces. A PLAINTEXT port must be left open throughout so brokers and/or clients can continue to communicate.
        <p></p>

        When performing an incremental bounce stop the brokers cleanly via a SIGTERM. It's also good practice to wait for restarted replicas to return to the ISR list before moving onto the next node.
        <p></p>
        As an example, say we wish to encrypt both broker-client and broker-broker communication with SSL. In the first incremental bounce, an SSL port is opened on each node:
        <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">listeners=PLAINTEXT://broker1:9091,SSL://broker1:9092<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>

        We then restart the clients, changing their config to point at the newly opened, secured port:

        <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">bootstrap.servers = [broker1:9092,...]
security.protocol = SSL
...etc<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>

        In the second incremental server bounce we instruct Kafka to use SSL as the broker-broker protocol (which will use the same SSL port):

        <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">listeners=PLAINTEXT://broker1:9091,SSL://broker1:9092
security.inter.broker.protocol=SSL<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>

        In the final bounce we secure the cluster by closing the PLAINTEXT port:

        <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">listeners=SSL://broker1:9092
security.inter.broker.protocol=SSL<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>

        Alternatively we might choose to open multiple ports so that different protocols can be used for broker-broker and broker-client communication. Say we wished to use SSL encryption throughout (i.e. for broker-broker and broker-client communication) but we'd like to add SASL authentication to the broker-client connection also. We would achieve this by opening two additional ports during the first bounce:

        <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">listeners=PLAINTEXT://broker1:9091,SSL://broker1:9092,SASL_SSL://broker1:9093<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>

        We would then restart the clients, changing their config to point at the newly opened, SASL &amp; SSL secured port:

        <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">bootstrap.servers = [broker1:9093,...]
security.protocol = SASL_SSL
...etc<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>

        The second server bounce would switch the cluster to use encrypted broker-broker communication via the SSL port we previously opened on port 9092:

        <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">listeners=PLAINTEXT://broker1:9091,SSL://broker1:9092,SASL_SSL://broker1:9093
security.inter.broker.protocol=SSL<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>

        The final bounce secures the cluster by closing the PLAINTEXT port.

        <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">listeners=SSL://broker1:9092,SASL_SSL://broker1:9093
security.inter.broker.protocol=SSL<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>

        ZooKeeper can be secured independently of the Kafka cluster. The steps for doing this are covered in section <a href="#zk_authz_migration">7.7.2</a>.


        <h3 class="anchor-heading"><a id="zk_authz" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#zk_authz">7.7 ZooKeeper Authentication</a></h3>
        ZooKeeper supports mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication beginning with the 3.5.x versions.
        Kafka supports authenticating to ZooKeeper with SASL and mTLS -- either individually or both together --
        beginning with version 2.5. See
        <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-515%3A+Enable+ZK+client+to+use+the+new+TLS+supported+authentication">KIP-515: Enable ZK client to use the new TLS supported authentication</a>
        for more details.
        <p>When using mTLS alone, every broker and any CLI tools (such as the <a href="#zk_authz_migration">ZooKeeper Security Migration Tool</a>)
            should identify itself with the same Distinguished Name (DN) because it is the DN that is ACL'ed.
            This can be changed as described below, but it involves writing and deploying a custom ZooKeeper authentication provider.
            Generally each certificate should have the same DN but a different Subject Alternative Name (SAN)
            so that hostname verification of the brokers and any CLI tools by ZooKeeper will succeed.
        </p>
        <p>
            When using SASL authentication to ZooKeeper together with mTLS, both the SASL identity and
            either the DN that created the znode (i.e. the creating broker's certificate)
            or the DN of the Security Migration Tool (if migration was performed after the znode was created)
            will be ACL'ed, and all brokers and CLI tools will be authorized even if they all use different DNs
            because they will all use the same ACL'ed SASL identity.
            It is only when  using mTLS authentication alone that all the DNs must match (and SANs become critical --
            again, in the absence of writing and deploying a custom ZooKeeper authentication provider as described below).
        </p>
        <p>
            Use the broker properties file to set TLS configs for brokers as described below.
        </p>
        <p>
            Use the <tt>--zk-tls-config-file &lt;file&gt;</tt> option to set TLS configs in the Zookeeper Security Migration Tool.
            The <tt>kafka-acls.sh</tt> and <tt>kafka-configs.sh</tt> CLI tools also support the <tt>--zk-tls-config-file &lt;file&gt;</tt> option.

        To enable ZooKeeper SASL authentication on brokers, there are two necessary steps:
        <ol>
            <li> Create a JAAS login file and set the appropriate system property to point to it as described above</li>
            <li> Set the configuration property <tt>zookeeper.set.acl</tt> in each broker to true</li>
        </ol>

        The metadata stored in ZooKeeper for the Kafka cluster is world-readable, but can only be modified by the brokers. The rationale behind this decision is that the data stored in ZooKeeper is not sensitive, but inappropriate manipulation of that data can cause cluster disruption. We also recommend limiting the access to ZooKeeper via network segmentation (only brokers and some admin tools need access to ZooKeeper).

        <h5 class="anchor-heading"><a id="zk_authz_new_mtls" class="anchor-link"></a><a href="#zk_authz_new_mtls">7.7.1.2 ZooKeeper Mutual TLS Authentication</a></h5>
        ZooKeeper mTLS authentication can be enabled with or without SASL authentication.  As mentioned above,
        when using mTLS alone, every broker and any CLI tools (such as the <a href="#zk_authz_migration">ZooKeeper Security Migration Tool</a>)
        must generally identify itself with the same Distinguished Name (DN) because it is the DN that is ACL'ed, which means
        each certificate should have an appropriate Subject Alternative Name (SAN) so that
        hostname verification of the brokers and any CLI tool by ZooKeeper will succeed.
        <p>
            It is possible to use something other than the DN for the identity of mTLS clients by writing a class that
            extends <tt>org.apache.zookeeper.server.auth.X509AuthenticationProvider</tt> and overrides the method
            <tt>protected String getClientId(X509Certificate clientCert)</tt>.
            Choose a scheme name and set <tt>authProvider.[scheme]</tt> in ZooKeeper to be the fully-qualified class name
            of the custom implementation; then set <tt>ssl.authProvider=[scheme]</tt> to use it.
        </p>
        Here is a sample (partial) ZooKeeper configuration for enabling TLS authentication.

        If you are running a version of Kafka that does not support security or simply with security disabled, and you want to make the cluster secure, then you need to execute the following steps to enable ZooKeeper authentication with minimal disruption to your operations:
        <ol>
            <li>Enable SASL and/or mTLS authentication on ZooKeeper.  If enabling mTLS, you would now have both a non-TLS port and a TLS port, like this:
                <pre class="line-numbers language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">clientPort=2181
secureClientPort=2182
serverCnxnFactory=org.apache.zookeeper.server.NettyServerCnxnFactory

            </li>
            <li>Perform a rolling restart of brokers setting the JAAS login file and/or defining ZooKeeper mutual TLS configurations (including connecting to the TLS-enabled ZooKeeper port) as required, which enables brokers to authenticate to ZooKeeper. At the end of the rolling restart, brokers are able to manipulate znodes with strict ACLs, but they will not create znodes with those ACLs</li>
            <li>If you enabled mTLS, disable the non-TLS port in ZooKeeper</li>
            <li>Perform a second rolling restart of brokers, this time setting the configuration parameter <tt>zookeeper.set.acl</tt> to true, which enables the use of secure ACLs when creating znodes</li>
            <li>Execute the ZkSecurityMigrator tool. To execute the tool, there is this script: <tt>bin/zookeeper-security-migration.sh</tt> with <tt>zookeeper.acl</tt> set to secure. This tool traverses the corresponding sub-trees changing the ACLs of the znodes. Use the <code>--zk-tls-config-file &lt;file&gt;</code> option if you enable mTLS.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>It is also possible to turn off authentication in a secure cluster. To do it, follow these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Perform a rolling restart of brokers setting the JAAS login file and/or defining ZooKeeper mutual TLS configurations, which enables brokers to authenticate, but setting <tt>zookeeper.set.acl</tt> to false. At the end of the rolling restart, brokers stop creating znodes with secure ACLs, but are still able to authenticate and manipulate all znodes</li>
            <li>Execute the ZkSecurityMigrator tool. To execute the tool, run this script <tt>bin/zookeeper-security-migration.sh</tt> with <tt>zookeeper.acl</tt> set to unsecure. This tool traverses the corresponding sub-trees changing the ACLs of the znodes. Use the <code>--zk-tls-config-file &lt;file&gt;</code> option if you need to set TLS configuration.</li>
            <li>If you are disabling mTLS, enable the non-TLS port in ZooKeeper</li>
            <li>Perform a second rolling restart of brokers, this time omitting the system property that sets the JAAS login file and/or removing ZooKeeper mutual TLS configuration (including connecting to the non-TLS-enabled ZooKeeper port) as required</li>
            <li>If you are disabling mTLS, disable the TLS port in ZooKeeper</li>
        </ol>
        Here is an example of how to run the migration tool:

    <div class="p-connect">
        <h3><a id="connect_overview" href="#connect_overview">8.1 Overview</a></h3>

        <p>Kafka Connect is a tool for scalably and reliably streaming data between Apache Kafka and other systems. It makes it simple to quickly define <i>connectors</i> that move large collections of data into and out of Kafka. Kafka Connect can ingest entire databases or collect metrics from all your application servers into Kafka topics, making the data available for stream processing with low latency. An export job can deliver data from Kafka topics into secondary storage and query systems or into batch systems for offline analysis.</p>

        <p>Kafka Connect features include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>A common framework for Kafka connectors</b> - Kafka Connect standardizes integration of other data systems with Kafka, simplifying connector development, deployment, and management</li>
            <li><b>Distributed and standalone modes</b> - scale up to a large, centrally managed service supporting an entire organization or scale down to development, testing, and small production deployments</li>
            <li><b>REST interface</b> - submit and manage connectors to your Kafka Connect cluster via an easy to use REST API</li>
            <li><b>Automatic offset management</b> - with just a little information from connectors, Kafka Connect can manage the offset commit process automatically so connector developers do not need to worry about this error prone part of connector development</li>
            <li><b>Distributed and scalable by default</b> - Kafka Connect builds on the existing group management protocol. More workers can be added to scale up a Kafka Connect cluster.</li>
            <li><b>Streaming/batch integration</b> - leveraging Kafka's existing capabilities, Kafka Connect is an ideal solution for bridging streaming and batch data systems</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><a id="connect_user" href="#connect_user">8.2 User Guide</a></h3>

        <p>The <a href="../quickstart">quickstart</a> provides a brief example of how to run a standalone version of Kafka Connect. This section describes how to configure, run, and manage Kafka Connect in more detail.</p>

        <h4><a id="connect_running" href="#connect_running">Running Kafka Connect</a></h4>

        <p>Kafka Connect currently supports two modes of execution: standalone (single process) and distributed.</p>

        <p>In standalone mode all work is performed in a single process. This configuration is simpler to setup and get started with and may be useful in situations where only one worker makes sense (e.g. collecting log files), but it does not benefit from some of the features of Kafka Connect such as fault tolerance. You can start a standalone process with the following command:</p>

        <pre class="brush: bash;">&gt; bin/connect-standalone.sh config/connect-standalone.properties [connector1.properties connector2.properties ...]</pre>

        <p>The first parameter is the configuration for the worker. This includes settings such as the Kafka connection parameters, serialization format, and how frequently to commit offsets. The provided example should work well with a local cluster running with the default configuration provided by <code>config/server.properties</code>. It will require tweaking to use with a different configuration or production deployment. All workers (both standalone and distributed) require a few configs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>bootstrap.servers</code> - List of Kafka servers used to bootstrap connections to Kafka</li>
            <li><code>key.converter</code> - Converter class used to convert between Kafka Connect format and the serialized form that is written to Kafka. This controls the format of the keys in messages written to or read from Kafka, and since this is independent of connectors it allows any connector to work with any serialization format. Examples of common formats include JSON and Avro.</li>
            <li><code>value.converter</code> - Converter class used to convert between Kafka Connect format and the serialized form that is written to Kafka. This controls the format of the values in messages written to or read from Kafka, and since this is independent of connectors it allows any connector to work with any serialization format. Examples of common formats include JSON and Avro.</li>
            <li><code>plugin.path</code> (default <code>empty</code>) - a list of paths that contain Connect plugins (connectors, converters, transformations). Before running quick starts, users must add the absolute path that contains the example FileStreamSourceConnector and FileStreamSinkConnector packaged in <code>connect-file-"version".jar</code>, because these connectors are not included by default to the <code>CLASSPATH</code> or the <code>plugin.path</code> of the Connect worker (see <a href="#connectconfigs_plugin.path">plugin.path</a> property for examples).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The important configuration options specific to standalone mode are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>offset.storage.file.filename</code> - File to store source connector offsets</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The parameters that are configured here are intended for producers and consumers used by Kafka Connect to access the configuration, offset and status topics. For configuration of the producers used by Kafka source tasks and the consumers used by Kafka sink tasks, the same parameters can be used but need to be prefixed with <code>producer.</code> and <code>consumer.</code> respectively. The only Kafka client parameter that is inherited without a prefix from the worker configuration is <code>bootstrap.servers</code>, which in most cases will be sufficient, since the same cluster is often used for all purposes. A notable exception is a secured cluster, which requires extra parameters to allow connections. These parameters will need to be set up to three times in the worker configuration, once for management access, once for Kafka sources and once for Kafka sinks.</p>

        <p>Starting with 2.3.0, client configuration overrides can be configured individually per connector by using the prefixes <code>producer.override.</code> and <code>consumer.override.</code> for Kafka sources or Kafka sinks respectively. These overrides are included with the rest of the connector's configuration properties.</p>

        <p>The remaining parameters are connector configuration files. You may include as many as you want, but all will execute within the same process (on different threads). You can also choose not to specify any connector configuration files on the command line, and instead use the REST API to create connectors at runtime after your standalone worker starts.</p>

        <p>Distributed mode handles automatic balancing of work, allows you to scale up (or down) dynamically, and offers fault tolerance both in the active tasks and for configuration and offset commit data. Execution is very similar to standalone mode:</p>

        <pre class="brush: bash;">&gt; bin/connect-distributed.sh config/connect-distributed.properties</pre>

        <p>The difference is in the class which is started and the configuration parameters which change how the Kafka Connect process decides where to store configurations, how to assign work, and where to store offsets and task statues. In the distributed mode, Kafka Connect stores the offsets, configs and task statuses in Kafka topics. It is recommended to manually create the topics for offset, configs and statuses in order to achieve the desired the number of partitions and replication factors. If the topics are not yet created when starting Kafka Connect, the topics will be auto created with default number of partitions and replication factor, which may not be best suited for its usage.</p>

        <p>In particular, the following configuration parameters, in addition to the common settings mentioned above, are critical to set before starting your cluster:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>group.id</code> (default <code>connect-cluster</code>) - unique name for the cluster, used in forming the Connect cluster group; note that this <b>must not conflict</b> with consumer group IDs</li>
            <li><code>config.storage.topic</code> (default <code>connect-configs</code>) - topic to use for storing connector and task configurations; note that this should be a single partition, highly replicated, compacted topic. You may need to manually create the topic to ensure the correct configuration as auto created topics may have multiple partitions or be automatically configured for deletion rather than compaction</li>
            <li><code>offset.storage.topic</code> (default <code>connect-offsets</code>) - topic to use for storing offsets; this topic should have many partitions, be replicated, and be configured for compaction</li>
            <li><code>status.storage.topic</code> (default <code>connect-status</code>) - topic to use for storing statuses; this topic can have multiple partitions, and should be replicated and configured for compaction</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Note that in distributed mode the connector configurations are not passed on the command line. Instead, use the REST API described below to create, modify, and destroy connectors.</p>


        <h4><a id="connect_configuring" href="#connect_configuring">Configuring Connectors</a></h4>

        <p>Connector configurations are simple key-value mappings. In both standalone and distributed mode, they are included in the JSON payload for the REST request that creates (or modifies) the connector. In standalone mode these can also be defined in a properties file and passed to the Connect process on the command line.</p>

        <p>Most configurations are connector dependent, so they can't be outlined here. However, there are a few common options:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><code>name</code> - Unique name for the connector. Attempting to register again with the same name will fail.</li>
            <li><code>connector.class</code> - The Java class for the connector</li>
            <li><code>tasks.max</code> - The maximum number of tasks that should be created for this connector. The connector may create fewer tasks if it cannot achieve this level of parallelism.</li>
            <li><code>key.converter</code> - (optional) Override the default key converter set by the worker.</li>
            <li><code>value.converter</code> - (optional) Override the default value converter set by the worker.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The <code>connector.class</code> config supports several formats: the full name or alias of the class for this connector. If the connector is org.apache.kafka.connect.file.FileStreamSinkConnector, you can either specify this full name or use FileStreamSink or FileStreamSinkConnector to make the configuration a bit shorter.</p>

        <p>Sink connectors also have a few additional options to control their input. Each sink connector must set one of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>topics</code> - A comma-separated list of topics to use as input for this connector</li>
            <li><code>topics.regex</code> - A Java regular expression of topics to use as input for this connector</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For any other options, you should consult the documentation for the connector.</p>

        <h4><a id="connect_transforms" href="#connect_transforms">Transformations</a></h4>

        <p>Connectors can be configured with transformations to make lightweight message-at-a-time modifications. They can be convenient for data massaging and event routing.</p>

        <p>A transformation chain can be specified in the connector configuration.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><code>transforms</code> - List of aliases for the transformation, specifying the order in which the transformations will be applied.</li>
            <li><code>transforms.$alias.type</code> - Fully qualified class name for the transformation.</li>
            <li><code>transforms.$alias.$transformationSpecificConfig</code> Configuration properties for the transformation</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For example, lets take the built-in file source connector and use a transformation to add a static field.</p>

        <p>Throughout the example we'll use schemaless JSON data format. To use schemaless format, we changed the following two lines in <code>connect-standalone.properties</code> from true to false:</p>

        <pre class="brush: text;">key.converter.schemas.enable
value.converter.schemas.enable</pre>

        <p>The file source connector reads each line as a String. We will wrap each line in a Map and then add a second field to identify the origin of the event. To do this, we use two transformations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>HoistField</b> to place the input line inside a Map</li>
            <li><b>InsertField</b> to add the static field. In this example we'll indicate that the record came from a file connector</li>
        </ul>

        <p>After adding the transformations, <code>connect-file-source.properties</code> file looks as following:</p>

        <pre class="brush: text;">name=local-file-source
connector.class=FileStreamSource
tasks.max=1
file=test.txt
topic=connect-test
transforms=MakeMap, InsertSource
transforms.MakeMap.type=org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.HoistField$Value
transforms.MakeMap.field=line
transforms.InsertSource.type=org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.InsertField$Value
transforms.InsertSource.static.field=data_source
transforms.InsertSource.static.value=test-file-source</pre>

        <p>All the lines starting with <code>transforms</code> were added for the transformations. You can see the two transformations we created: "InsertSource" and "MakeMap" are aliases that we chose to give the transformations. The transformation types are based on the list of built-in transformations you can see below. Each transformation type has additional configuration: HoistField requires a configuration called "field", which is the name of the field in the map that will include the original String from the file. InsertField transformation lets us specify the field name and the value that we are adding.</p>

        <p>When we ran the file source connector on my sample file without the transformations, and then read them using <code>kafka-console-consumer.sh</code>, the results were:</p>

        <pre class="brush: text;">"foo"
"bar"
"hello world"</pre>

        <p>We then create a new file connector, this time after adding the transformations to the configuration file. This time, the results will be:</p>

        <pre class="brush: json;">{"line":"foo","data_source":"test-file-source"}
{"line":"bar","data_source":"test-file-source"}

        <p>You can see that the lines we've read are now part of a JSON map, and there is an extra field with the static value we specified. This is just one example of what you can do with transformations.</p>

        <h5><a id="connect_included_transformation" href="#connect_included_transformation">Included transformations</a></h5>

        <p>Several widely-applicable data and routing transformations are included with Kafka Connect:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>InsertField - Add a field using either static data or record metadata</li>
            <li>ReplaceField - Filter or rename fields</li>
            <li>MaskField - Replace field with valid null value for the type (0, empty string, etc) or custom replacement (non-empty string or numeric value only)</li>
            <li>ValueToKey - Replace the record key with a new key formed from a subset of fields in the record value</li>
            <li>HoistField - Wrap the entire event as a single field inside a Struct or a Map</li>
            <li>ExtractField - Extract a specific field from Struct and Map and include only this field in results</li>
            <li>SetSchemaMetadata - modify the schema name or version</li>
            <li>TimestampRouter - Modify the topic of a record based on original topic and timestamp. Useful when using a sink that needs to write to different tables or indexes based on timestamps</li>
            <li>RegexRouter - modify the topic of a record based on original topic, replacement string and a regular expression</li>
            <li>Filter - Removes messages from all further processing. This is used with a <a href="#connect_predicates">predicate</a> to selectively filter certain messages.</li>
            <li>InsertHeader - Add a header using static data</li>
            <li>HeadersFrom - Copy or move fields in the key or value to the record headers</li>
            <li>DropHeaders - Remove headers by name</li>
        </ul>

        <h5><a id="connect_predicates" href="#connect_predicates">Predicates</a></h5>

        <p>Transformations can be configured with predicates so that the transformation is applied only to messages which satisfy some condition. In particular, when combined with the <b>Filter</b> transformation predicates can be used to selectively filter out certain messages.</p>

        <p>Predicates are specified in the connector configuration.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><code>predicates</code> - Set of aliases for the predicates to be applied to some of the transformations.</li>
            <li><code>predicates.$alias.type</code> - Fully qualified class name for the predicate.</li>
            <li><code>predicates.$alias.$predicateSpecificConfig</code> - Configuration properties for the predicate.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>All transformations have the implicit config properties <code>predicate</code> and <code>negate</code>. A predicular predicate is associated with a transformation by setting the transformation's <code>predicate</code> config to the predicate's alias. The predicate's value can be reversed using the <code>negate</code> configuration property.</p>

        <p>For example, suppose you have a source connector which produces messages to many different topics and you want to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>filter out the messages in the 'foo' topic entirely</li>
            <li>apply the ExtractField transformation with the field name 'other_field' to records in all topics <i>except</i> the topic 'bar'</li>
        </ul>

        <p>To do this we need first to filter out the records destined for the topic 'foo'. The Filter transformation removes records from further processing, and can use the TopicNameMatches predicate to apply the transformation only to records in topics which match a certain regular expression. TopicNameMatches's only configuration property is <code>pattern</code> which is a Java regular expression for matching against the topic name. The configuration would look like this:</p>

        <pre class="brush: text;">transforms=Filter
transforms.Filter.type=org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.Filter
transforms.Filter.predicate=IsFoo

predicates=IsFoo
predicates.IsFoo.type=org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.predicates.TopicNameMatches
predicates.IsFoo.pattern=foo</pre>

        <p>Next we need to apply ExtractField only when the topic name of the record is not 'bar'. We can't just use TopicNameMatches directly, because that would apply the transformation to matching topic names, not topic names which do <i>not</i> match. The transformation's implicit <code>negate</code> config properties allows us to invert the set of records which a predicate matches. Adding the configuration for this to the previous example we arrive at:</p>

        <pre class="brush: text;">transforms=Filter,Extract
transforms.Filter.type=org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.Filter
transforms.Filter.predicate=IsFoo

transforms.Extract.type=org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.ExtractField$Key
transforms.Extract.field=other_field
transforms.Extract.predicate=IsBar
transforms.Extract.negate=true

predicates=IsFoo,IsBar
predicates.IsFoo.type=org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.predicates.TopicNameMatches
predicates.IsFoo.pattern=foo

predicates.IsBar.type=org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.predicates.TopicNameMatches
predicates.IsBar.pattern=bar</pre>

        <p>Kafka Connect includes the following predicates:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><code>TopicNameMatches</code> - matches records in a topic with a name matching a particular Java regular expression.</li>
            <li><code>HasHeaderKey</code> - matches records which have a header with the given key.</li>
            <li><code>RecordIsTombstone</code> - matches tombstone records, that is records with a null value.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Details on how to configure each predicate are listed below:</p>

        <h4><a id="connect_rest" href="#connect_rest">REST API</a></h4>

        <p>Since Kafka Connect is intended to be run as a service, it also provides a REST API for managing connectors. This REST API is available in both standalone and distributed mode. The REST API server can be configured using the <code>listeners</code> configuration option.
            This field should contain a list of listeners in the following format: <code>protocol://host:port,protocol2://host2:port2</code>. Currently supported protocols are <code>http</code> and <code>https</code>.
            For example:</p>

        <pre class="brush: text;">listeners=http://localhost:8080,https://localhost:8443</pre>

        <p>By default, if no <code>listeners</code> are specified, the REST server runs on port 8083 using the HTTP protocol. When using HTTPS, the configuration has to include the SSL configuration.
            By default, it will use the <code>ssl.*</code> settings. In case it is needed to use different configuration for the REST API than for connecting to Kafka brokers, the fields can be prefixed with <code>listeners.https</code>.
            When using the prefix, only the prefixed options will be used and the <code>ssl.*</code> options without the prefix will be ignored. Following fields can be used to configure HTTPS for the REST API:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><code>ssl.keystore.location</code></li>
            <li><code>ssl.keystore.password</code></li>
            <li><code>ssl.keystore.type</code></li>
            <li><code>ssl.key.password</code></li>
            <li><code>ssl.truststore.location</code></li>
            <li><code>ssl.truststore.password</code></li>
            <li><code>ssl.truststore.type</code></li>
            <li><code>ssl.enabled.protocols</code></li>
            <li><code>ssl.provider</code></li>
            <li><code>ssl.protocol</code></li>
            <li><code>ssl.cipher.suites</code></li>
            <li><code>ssl.keymanager.algorithm</code></li>
            <li><code>ssl.secure.random.implementation</code></li>
            <li><code>ssl.trustmanager.algorithm</code></li>
            <li><code>ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm</code></li>
            <li><code>ssl.client.auth</code></li>
        </ul>

        <p>The REST API is used not only by users to monitor / manage Kafka Connect. In distributed mode, it is also used for the Kafka Connect cross-cluster communication. Some requests received on the follower nodes REST API will be forwarded to the leader node REST API.
            In case the URI under which is given host reachable is different from the URI which it listens on, the configuration options <code>rest.advertised.host.name</code>, <code>rest.advertised.port</code> and <code>rest.advertised.listener</code>
            can be used to change the URI which will be used by the follower nodes to connect with the leader. When using both HTTP and HTTPS listeners, the <code>rest.advertised.listener</code> option can be also used to define which listener
            will be used for the cross-cluster communication. When using HTTPS for communication between nodes, the same <code>ssl.*</code> or <code>listeners.https</code> options will be used to configure the HTTPS client.</p>

        <p>The following are the currently supported REST API endpoints:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><code>GET /connectors</code> - return a list of active connectors</li>
            <li><code>POST /connectors</code> - create a new connector; the request body should be a JSON object containing a string <code>name</code> field and an object <code>config</code> field with the connector configuration parameters</li>
            <li><code>GET /connectors/{name}</code> - get information about a specific connector</li>
            <li><code>GET /connectors/{name}/config</code> - get the configuration parameters for a specific connector</li>
            <li><code>PUT /connectors/{name}/config</code> - update the configuration parameters for a specific connector</li>
            <li><code>GET /connectors/{name}/status</code> - get current status of the connector, including if it is running, failed, paused, etc., which worker it is assigned to, error information if it has failed, and the state of all its tasks</li>
            <li><code>GET /connectors/{name}/tasks</code> - get a list of tasks currently running for a connector</li>
            <li><code>GET /connectors/{name}/tasks/{taskid}/status</code> - get current status of the task, including if it is running, failed, paused, etc., which worker it is assigned to, and error information if it has failed</li>
            <li><code>PUT /connectors/{name}/pause</code> - pause the connector and its tasks, which stops message processing until the connector is resumed. Any resources claimed by its tasks are left allocated, which allows the connector to begin processing data quickly once it is resumed.</li>
            <li id="connect_stopconnector"><code>PUT /connectors/{name}/stop</code> - stop the connector and shut down its tasks, deallocating any resources claimed by its tasks. This is more efficient from a resource usage standpoint than pausing the connector, but can cause it to take longer to begin processing data once resumed. Note that the offsets for a connector can be only modified via the offsets management endpoints if it is in the stopped state</li>
            <li><code>PUT /connectors/{name}/resume</code> - resume a paused or stopped connector (or do nothing if the connector is not paused or stopped)</li>
            <li><code>POST /connectors/{name}/restart?includeTasks=&lt;true|false&gt;&amp;onlyFailed=&lt;true|false&gt;</code> - restart a connector and its tasks instances.
                <ul>
                    <li>the "includeTasks" parameter specifies whether to restart the connector instance and task instances ("includeTasks=true") or just the connector instance ("includeTasks=false"), with the default ("false") preserving the same behavior as earlier versions.</li>
                    <li>the "onlyFailed" parameter specifies whether to restart just the instances with a FAILED status ("onlyFailed=true") or all instances ("onlyFailed=false"), with the default ("false") preserving the same behavior as earlier versions.</li>

            </li>
            <li><code>POST /connectors/{name}/tasks/{taskId}/restart</code> - restart an individual task (typically because it has failed)</li>
            <li><code>DELETE /connectors/{name}</code> - delete a connector, halting all tasks and deleting its configuration</li>
            <li><code>GET /connectors/{name}/topics</code> - get the set of topics that a specific connector is using since the connector was created or since a request to reset its set of active topics was issued</li>
            <li><code>PUT /connectors/{name}/topics/reset</code> - send a request to empty the set of active topics of a connector</li>
            <li>Offsets management endpoints (see <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-875%3A+First-class+offsets+support+in+Kafka+Connect">KIP-875</a> for more details):

                    <li><code>PATCH /connectors/{name}/offsets</code> - alter the offsets for a connector. The connector must exist and must be in the stopped state (see <a href="#connect_stopconnector"><code>PUT /connectors/{name}/stop</code></a>).

        "filename": "test.txt"
      },
      "offset": {

      }
    }
  ]
}
                </code></pre>
                    An example request body for the <code>FileStreamSinkConnector</code>:

                    The "offset" field may be null to reset the offset for a specific partition (applicable to both source and sink connectors). Note that the request body format depends on the connector implementation in the case of source connectors, whereas there is a common format across all sink connectors.
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Kafka Connect also provides a REST API for getting information about connector plugins:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><code>GET /connector-plugins</code>- return a list of connector plugins installed in the Kafka Connect cluster. Note that the API only checks for connectors on the worker that handles the request, which means you may see inconsistent results, especially during a rolling upgrade if you add new connector jars</li>
            <li><code>GET /connector-plugins/{plugin-type}/config</code> - get the configuration definition for the specified plugin.</li>
            <li><code>PUT /connector-plugins/{connector-type}/config/validate</code> - validate the provided configuration values against the configuration definition. This API performs per config validation, returns suggested values and error messages during validation.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The following is a supported REST request at the top-level (root) endpoint:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><code>GET /</code>- return basic information about the Kafka Connect cluster such as the version of the Connect worker that serves the REST request (including git commit ID of the source code) and the Kafka cluster ID that is connected to.
            </li></ul>

        <p>The <code>admin.listeners</code> configuration can be used to configure admin REST APIs on Kafka Connect's REST API server. Similar to the <code>listeners</code> configuration, this field should contain a list of listeners in the following format: <code>protocol://host:port,protocol2://host2:port2</code>. Currently supported protocols are <code>http</code> and <code>https</code>.
            For example:</p>

        <pre class="brush: text;">admin.listeners=http://localhost:8080,https://localhost:8443</pre>

        <p>By default, if <code>admin.listeners</code> is not configured, the admin REST APIs will be available on the regular listeners.</p>

        <p>The following are the currently supported admin REST API endpoints:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><code>GET /admin/loggers</code> - list the current loggers that have their levels explicitly set and their log levels</li>
            <li><code>GET /admin/loggers/{name}</code> - get the log level for the specified logger</li>
            <li><code>PUT /admin/loggers/{name}</code> - set the log level for the specified logger</li>
        </ul>

        <h4><a id="connect_errorreporting" href="#connect_errorreporting">Error Reporting in Connect</a></h4>

        <p>Kafka Connect provides error reporting to handle errors encountered along various stages of processing. By default, any error encountered during conversion or within transformations will cause the connector to fail. Each connector configuration can also enable tolerating such errors by skipping them, optionally writing each error and the details of the failed operation and problematic record (with various levels of detail) to the Connect application log. These mechanisms also capture errors when a sink connector is processing the messages consumed from its Kafka topics, and all of the errors can be written to a configurable "dead letter queue" (DLQ) Kafka topic.</p>

        <p>To report errors within a connector's converter, transforms, or within the sink connector itself to the log, set <code>errors.log.enable=true</code> in the connector configuration to log details of each error and problem record's topic, partition, and offset. For additional debugging purposes, set <code>errors.log.include.messages=true</code> to also log the problem record key, value, and headers to the log (note this may log sensitive information).</p>

        <p>To report errors within a connector's converter, transforms, or within the sink connector itself to a dead letter queue topic, set <code>errors.deadletterqueue.topic.name</code>, and optionally <code>errors.deadletterqueue.context.headers.enable=true</code>.</p>

        <p>By default connectors exhibit "fail fast" behavior immediately upon an error or exception. This is equivalent to adding the following configuration properties with their defaults to a connector configuration:</p>

        <pre class="brush: text;"># disable retries on failure
errors.retry.timeout=0

# do not log the error and their contexts
errors.log.enable=false

# do not record errors in a dead letter queue topic
errors.deadletterqueue.topic.name=

# Fail on first error
errors.tolerance=none</pre>

        <p>These and other related connector configuration properties can be changed to provide different behavior. For example, the following configuration properties can be added to a connector configuration to setup error handling with multiple retries, logging to the application logs and the <code>my-connector-errors</code> Kafka topic, and tolerating all errors by reporting them rather than failing the connector task:</p>

        <pre class="brush: text;"># retry for at most 10 minutes times waiting up to 30 seconds between consecutive failures
errors.retry.timeout=600000
errors.retry.delay.max.ms=30000

# log error context along with application logs, but do not include configs and messages
errors.log.enable=true
errors.log.include.messages=false

# produce error context into the Kafka topic
errors.deadletterqueue.topic.name=my-connector-errors

# Tolerate all errors.
errors.tolerance=all</pre>

        <h4><a id="connect_exactlyonce" href="#connect_exactlyonce">Exactly-once support</a></h4>

        <p>Kafka Connect is capable of providing exactly-once semantics for sink connectors (as of version 0.11.0) and source connectors (as of version 3.3.0). Please note that <b>support for exactly-once semantics is highly dependent on the type of connector you run.</b> Even if you set all the correct worker properties in the configuration for each node in a cluster, if a connector is not designed to, or cannot take advantage of the capabilities of the Kafka Connect framework, exactly-once may not be possible.</p>

        <h5><a id="connect_exactlyoncesink" href="#connect_exactlyoncesink">Sink connectors</a></h5>

        <p>If a sink connector supports exactly-once semantics, to enable exactly-once at the Connect worker level, you must ensure its consumer group is configured to ignore records in aborted transactions. You can do this by setting the worker property <code>consumer.isolation.level</code> to <code>read_committed</code> or, if running a version of Kafka Connect that supports it, using a <a href="#connectconfigs_connector.client.config.override.policy">connector client config override policy</a> that allows the <code>consumer.override.isolation.level</code> property to be set to <code>read_committed</code> in individual connector configs. There are no additional ACL requirements.</p>

        <h5><a id="connect_exactlyoncesource" href="#connect_exactlyoncesource">Source connectors</a></h5>

        <p>If a source connector supports exactly-once semantics, you must configure your Connect cluster to enable framework-level support for exactly-once source connectors. Additional ACLs may be necessary if running against a secured Kafka cluster. Note that exactly-once support for source connectors is currently only available in distributed mode; standalone Connect workers cannot provide exactly-once semantics.</p>

        <h6>Worker configuration</h6>

        <p>For new Connect clusters, set the <code>exactly.once.source.support</code> property to <code>enabled</code> in the worker config for each node in the cluster. For existing clusters, two rolling upgrades are necessary. During the first upgrade, the <code>exactly.once.source.support</code> property should be set to <code>preparing</code>, and during the second, it should be set to <code>enabled</code>.</p>

        <h6>ACL requirements</h6>

        <p>With exactly-once source support enabled, the principal for each Connect worker will require the following ACLs:</p>

        <p>......</p>

        <p>And the principal for each individual connector will require the following ACLs:</p>

        <p>......</p>

        <h4><a id="connect_plugindiscovery" href="#connect_plugindiscovery">Plugin Discovery</a></h4>

        <p>Plugin discovery is the name for the strategy which the Connect worker uses to find plugin classes and make them accessible to configure and run in connectors. This is controlled by the <a href="#connectconfigs_plugin.discovery">plugin.discovery</a> worker configuration, and has a significant impact on worker startup time. <code>service_load</code> is the fastest strategy, but care should be taken to verify that plugins are compatible before setting this configuration to <code>service_load</code>.</p>

        <p>Prior to version 3.6, this strategy was not configurable, and behaved like the <code>only_scan</code> mode which is compatible with all plugins. For version 3.6 and later, this mode defaults to <code>hybrid_warn</code> which is also compatible with all plugins, but logs a warning for plugins which are incompatible with <code>service_load</code>. The <code>hybrid_fail</code> strategy stops the worker with an error if a plugin incompatible with <code>service_load</code> is detected, asserting that all plugins are compatible. Finally, the <code>service_load</code> strategy disables the slow legacy scanning mechanism used in all other modes, and instead uses the faster <code>ServiceLoader</code> mechanism. Plugins which are incompatible with that mechanism may be unusable.</p>

        <h5><a id="connect_plugindiscovery_compatibility" href="#connect_plugindiscovery_compatibility">Verifying Plugin Compatibility</a></h5>

        <p>To verify if all of your plugins are compatible with <code>service_load</code>, first ensure that you are using version 3.6 or later of Kafka Connect. You can then perform one of the following checks:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Start your worker with the default <code>hybrid_warn</code>strategy, and WARN logs enabled for the <code>org.apache.kafka.connect</code> package. At least one WARN log message mentioning the <code>plugin.discovery</code> configuration should be printed. This log message will explicitly say that all plugins are compatible, or list the incompatible plugins.</li>
            <li>Start your worker in a test environment with <code>hybrid_fail</code>. If all plugins are compatible, startup will succeed. If at least one plugin is not compatible the worker will fail to start up, and all incompatible plugins will be listed in the exception.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If the verification step succeeds, then your current set of installed plugins is compatible, and it should be safe to change the <code>plugin.discovery</code> configuration to <code>service_load</code>. If the verification fails, you cannot use <code>service_load</code> strategy and should take note of the list of incompatible plugins. All plugins must be addressed before using the <code>service_load</code> strategy. It is recommended to perform this verification after installing or changing plugin versions, and the verification can be done automatically in a Continuous Integration environment.</p>

        <h5><a id="connect_plugindiscovery_migrateartifact" href="#connect_plugindiscovery_migrateartifact">Operators: Artifact Migration</a></h5>

        <p>As an operator of Connect, if you discover incompatible plugins, there are multiple ways to resolve the incompatibility. They are listed below from most to least preferable.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Check the latest release from your plugin provider, and if it is compatible, upgrade.</li>
            <li>Contact your plugin provider and request that they migrate the plugin to be compatible, following the <a href="#connect_plugindiscovery_migratesource">source migration instructions</a>, and then upgrade to the compatible version.</li>
            <li>Migrate the plugin artifacts yourself using the included migration script.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The migration script is located in <code>bin/connect-plugin-path.sh</code> and <code>bin\windows\connect-plugin-path.bat</code> of your Kafka installation. The script can migrate incompatible plugin artifacts already installed on your Connect worker's <code>plugin.path</code> by adding or modifying JAR or resource files. This is not suitable for environments using code-signing, as this can change artifacts such that they will fail signature verification. View the built-in help with <code>--help</code>.</p>

        <p>To perform a migration, first use the <code>list</code> subcommand to get an overview of the plugins available to the script. You must tell the script where to find plugins, which can be done with the repeatable <code>--worker-config</code>, <code>--plugin-path</code>, and <code>--plugin-location</code> arguments. The script will ignore plugins on the classpath, so any custom plugins on your classpath should be moved to the plugin path in order to be used with this migration script, or migrated manually. Be sure to compare the output of <code>list</code> with the worker startup warning or error message to ensure that all of your affected plugins are found by the script.</p>

        <p>Once you see that all incompatible plugins are included in the listing, you can proceed to dry-run the migration with <code>sync-manifests --dry-run</code>. This will perform all parts of the migration, except for writing the results of the migration to disk. Note that the <code>sync-manifests</code> command requires all specified paths to be writable, and may alter the contents of the directories. Make a backup of your plugins in the specified paths, or copy them to a writable directory.</p>

        <p>Ensure that you have a backup of your plugins and the dry-run succeeds before removing the <code>--dry-run</code> flag and actually running the migration. If the migration fails without the <code>--dry-run</code> flag, then the partially migrated artifacts should be discarded. The migration is idempotent, so running it multiple times and on already-migrated plugins is safe. After the script finishes, you should <a href="#connect_plugindiscovery_compatibility">verify the migration is complete</a>. The migration script is suitable for use in a Continuous Integration environment for automatic migration.</p>

        <h5><a id="connect_plugindiscovery_migratesource" href="#connect_plugindiscovery_migratesource">Developers: Source Migration</a></h5>

        <p>To make plugins compatible with <code>service_load</code>, it is necessary to add <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html">ServiceLoader</a> manifests to your source code, which should then be packaged in the release artifact. Manifests are resource files in <code>META-INF/services/</code> named after their superclass type, and contain a list of fully-qualified subclass names, one on each line.</p>

        <p>In order for a plugin to be compatible, it must appear as a line in a manifest corresponding to the plugin superclass it extends. If a single plugin implements multiple plugin interfaces, then it should appear in a manifest for each interface it implements. If you have no classes for a certain type of plugin, you do not need to include a manifest file for that type. If you have classes which should not be visible as plugins, they should be marked abstract. The following types are expected to have manifests:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><code>org.apache.kafka.connect.sink.SinkConnector</code></li>
            <li><code>org.apache.kafka.connect.source.SourceConnector</code></li>
            <li><code>org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.Converter</code></li>
            <li><code>org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.HeaderConverter</code></li>
            <li><code>org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.Transformation</code></li>
            <li><code>org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.predicates.Predicate</code></li>
            <li><code>org.apache.kafka.common.config.provider.ConfigProvider</code></li>
            <li><code>org.apache.kafka.connect.rest.ConnectRestExtension</code></li>
            <li><code>org.apache.kafka.connect.connector.policy.ConnectorClientConfigOverridePolicy</code></li>
        </ul>

        <p>For example, if you only have one connector with the fully-qualified name <code>com.example.MySinkConnector</code>, then only one manifest file must be added to resources in <code>META-INF/services/org.apache.kafka.connect.sink.SinkConnector</code>, and the contents should be similar to the following:</p>

        <pre class="brush: resource;"># license header or comment
com.example.MySinkConnector</pre>

        <p>You should then verify that your manifests are correct by using the <a href="#connect_plugindiscovery_compatibility">verification steps</a> with a pre-release artifact. If the verification succeeds, you can then release the plugin normally, and operators can upgrade to the compatible version.</p>

        <h3><a id="connect_development" href="#connect_development">8.3 Connector Development Guide</a></h3>

        <p>This guide describes how developers can write new connectors for Kafka Connect to move data between Kafka and other systems. It briefly reviews a few key concepts and then describes how to create a simple connector.</p>

        <h4><a id="connect_concepts" href="#connect_concepts">Core Concepts and APIs</a></h4>

        <h5><a id="connect_connectorsandtasks" href="#connect_connectorsandtasks">Connectors and Tasks</a></h5>

        <p>To copy data between Kafka and another system, users create a <code>Connector</code> for the system they want to pull data from or push data to. Connectors come in two flavors: <code>SourceConnectors</code> import data from another system (e.g. <code>JDBCSourceConnector</code> would import a relational database into Kafka) and <code>SinkConnectors</code> export data (e.g. <code>HDFSSinkConnector</code> would export the contents of a Kafka topic to an HDFS file).</p>

        <p><code>Connectors</code> do not perform any data copying themselves: their configuration describes the data to be copied, and the <code>Connector</code> is responsible for breaking that job into a set of <code>Tasks</code> that can be distributed to workers. These <code>Tasks</code> also come in two corresponding flavors: <code>SourceTask</code> and <code>SinkTask</code>.</p>

        <p>With an assignment in hand, each <code>Task</code> must copy its subset of the data to or from Kafka. In Kafka Connect, it should always be possible to frame these assignments as a set of input and output streams consisting of records with consistent schemas. Sometimes this mapping is obvious: each file in a set of log files can be considered a stream with each parsed line forming a record using the same schema and offsets stored as byte offsets in the file. In other cases it may require more effort to map to this model: a JDBC connector can map each table to a stream, but the offset is less clear. One possible mapping uses a timestamp column to generate queries incrementally returning new data, and the last queried timestamp can be used as the offset.</p>


        <h5><a id="connect_streamsandrecords" href="#connect_streamsandrecords">Streams and Records</a></h5>

        <p>Each stream should be a sequence of key-value records. Both the keys and values can have complex structure -- many primitive types are provided, but arrays, objects, and nested data structures can be represented as well. The runtime data format does not assume any particular serialization format; this conversion is handled internally by the framework.</p>

        <p>In addition to the key and value, records (both those generated by sources and those delivered to sinks) have associated stream IDs and offsets. These are used by the framework to periodically commit the offsets of data that have been processed so that in the event of failures, processing can resume from the last committed offsets, avoiding unnecessary reprocessing and duplication of events.</p>

        <h5><a id="connect_dynamicconnectors" href="#connect_dynamicconnectors">Dynamic Connectors</a></h5>

        <p>Not all jobs are static, so <code>Connector</code> implementations are also responsible for monitoring the external system for any changes that might require reconfiguration. For example, in the <code>JDBCSourceConnector</code> example, the <code>Connector</code> might assign a set of tables to each <code>Task</code>. When a new table is created, it must discover this so it can assign the new table to one of the <code>Tasks</code> by updating its configuration. When it notices a change that requires reconfiguration (or a change in the number of <code>Tasks</code>), it notifies the framework and the framework updates any corresponding <code>Tasks</code>.</p>


        <h4><a id="connect_developing" href="#connect_developing">Developing a Simple Connector</a></h4>

        <p>Developing a connector only requires implementing two interfaces, the <code>Connector</code> and <code>Task</code>. A simple example is included with the source code for Kafka in the <code>file</code> package. This connector is meant for use in standalone mode and has implementations of a <code>SourceConnector</code>/<code>SourceTask</code> to read each line of a file and emit it as a record and a <code>SinkConnector</code>/<code>SinkTask</code> that writes each record to a file.</p>

        <p>The rest of this section will walk through some code to demonstrate the key steps in creating a connector, but developers should also refer to the full example source code as many details are omitted for brevity.</p>

        <h5><a id="connect_connectorexample" href="#connect_connectorexample">Connector Example</a></h5>

        <p>We'll cover the <code>SourceConnector</code> as a simple example. <code>SinkConnector</code> implementations are very similar. Pick a package and class name, these examples will use the <code>FileStreamSourceConnector</code> but substitute your own class name where appropriate. In order to <a href="#connect_plugindiscovery">make the plugin discoverable at runtime</a>, add a ServiceLoader manifest to your resources in <code>META-INF/services/org.apache.kafka.connect.source.SourceConnector</code> with your fully-qualified class name on a single line:</p>
        <pre class="brush: resource;">com.example.FileStreamSourceConnector</pre>

        <p>Create a class that inherits from <code>SourceConnector</code> and add a field that will store the configuration information to be propagated to the task(s) (the topic to send data to, and optionally - the filename to read from and the maximum batch size):</p>

        <pre class="brush: java;">package com.example;

public class FileStreamSourceConnector extends SourceConnector {
    private Map&lt;String, String&gt; props;</pre>

        <p>The easiest method to fill in is <code>taskClass()</code>, which defines the class that should be instantiated in worker processes to actually read the data:</p>

        <pre class="brush: java;">@Override
public Class&lt;? extends Task&gt; taskClass() {
    return FileStreamSourceTask.class;
}</pre>

        <p>We will define the <code>FileStreamSourceTask</code> class below. Next, we add some standard lifecycle methods, <code>start()</code> and <code>stop()</code>:</p>

        <pre class="brush: java;">@Override
public void start(Map&lt;String, String&gt; props) {
    // Initialization logic and setting up of resources can take place in this method.
    // This connector doesn't need to do any of that, but we do log a helpful message to the user.

    this.props = props;
    AbstractConfig config = new AbstractConfig(CONFIG_DEF, props);
    String filename = config.getString(FILE_CONFIG);
    filename = (filename == null || filename.isEmpty()) ? "standard input" : config.getString(FILE_CONFIG);
    log.info("Starting file source connector reading from {}", filename);
}

@Override
public void stop() {
    // Nothing to do since no background monitoring is required.
}</pre>

        <p>Finally, the real core of the implementation is in <code>taskConfigs()</code>. In this case we are only
            handling a single file, so even though we may be permitted to generate more tasks as per the
            <code>maxTasks</code> argument, we return a list with only one entry:</p>

        <pre class="brush: java;">@Override
public List&lt;Map&lt;String, String&gt;&gt; taskConfigs(int maxTasks) {
    // Note that the task configs could contain configs additional to or different from the connector configs if needed. For instance,
    // if different tasks have different responsibilities, or if different tasks are meant to process different subsets of the source data stream).
    ArrayList&lt;Map&lt;String, String&gt;&gt; configs = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
    // Only one input stream makes sense.
    configs.add(props);
    return configs;
}</pre>

        <p>Even with multiple tasks, this method implementation is usually pretty simple. It just has to determine the number of input tasks, which may require contacting the remote service it is pulling data from, and then divvy them up. Because some patterns for splitting work among tasks are so common, some utilities are provided in <code>ConnectorUtils</code> to simplify these cases.</p>

        <p>Note that this simple example does not include dynamic input. See the discussion in the next section for how to trigger updates to task configs.</p>

        <h5><a id="connect_taskexample" href="#connect_taskexample">Task Example - Source Task</a></h5>

        <p>Next we'll describe the implementation of the corresponding <code>SourceTask</code>. The implementation is short, but too long to cover completely in this guide. We'll use pseudo-code to describe most of the implementation, but you can refer to the source code for the full example.</p>

        <p>Just as with the connector, we need to create a class inheriting from the appropriate base <code>Task</code> class. It also has some standard lifecycle methods:</p>


        <pre class="brush: java;">public class FileStreamSourceTask extends SourceTask {
    private String filename;
    private InputStream stream;
    private String topic;
    private int batchSize;

    @Override
    public void start(Map&lt;String, String&gt; props) {
        filename = props.get(FileStreamSourceConnector.FILE_CONFIG);
        stream = openOrThrowError(filename);
        topic = props.get(FileStreamSourceConnector.TOPIC_CONFIG);
        batchSize = props.get(FileStreamSourceConnector.TASK_BATCH_SIZE_CONFIG);
    }

    @Override
    public synchronized void stop() {
        stream.close();
    }</pre>

        <p>These are slightly simplified versions, but show that these methods should be relatively simple and the only work they should perform is allocating or freeing resources. There are two points to note about this implementation. First, the <code>start()</code> method does not yet handle resuming from a previous offset, which will be addressed in a later section. Second, the <code>stop()</code> method is synchronized. This will be necessary because <code>SourceTasks</code> are given a dedicated thread which they can block indefinitely, so they need to be stopped with a call from a different thread in the Worker.</p>

        <p>Next, we implement the main functionality of the task, the <code>poll()</code> method which gets events from the input system and returns a <code>List&lt;SourceRecord&gt;</code>:</p>

        <pre class="brush: java;">@Override
public List&lt;SourceRecord&gt; poll() throws InterruptedException {
    try {
        ArrayList&lt;SourceRecord&gt; records = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
        while (streamValid(stream) &amp;&amp; records.isEmpty()) {
            LineAndOffset line = readToNextLine(stream);
            if (line != null) {
                Map&lt;String, Object&gt; sourcePartition = Collections.singletonMap("filename", filename);
                Map&lt;String, Object&gt; sourceOffset = Collections.singletonMap("position", streamOffset);
                records.add(new SourceRecord(sourcePartition, sourceOffset, topic, Schema.STRING_SCHEMA, line));
                if (records.size() &gt;= batchSize) {
                    return records;
                }
            } else {
                Thread.sleep(1);
            }
        }
        return records;
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // Underlying stream was killed, probably as a result of calling stop. Allow to return
        // null, and driving thread will handle any shutdown if necessary.
    }
    return null;
}</pre>

        <p>Again, we've omitted some details, but we can see the important steps: the <code>poll()</code> method is going to be called repeatedly, and for each call it will loop trying to read records from the file. For each line it reads, it also tracks the file offset. It uses this information to create an output <code>SourceRecord</code> with four pieces of information: the source partition (there is only one, the single file being read), source offset (byte offset in the file), output topic name, and output value (the line, and we include a schema indicating this value will always be a string). Other variants of the <code>SourceRecord</code> constructor can also include a specific output partition, a key, and headers.</p>

        <p>Note that this implementation uses the normal Java <code>InputStream</code> interface and may sleep if data is not available. This is acceptable because Kafka Connect provides each task with a dedicated thread. While task implementations have to conform to the basic <code>poll()</code> interface, they have a lot of flexibility in how they are implemented. In this case, an NIO-based implementation would be more efficient, but this simple approach works, is quick to implement, and is compatible with older versions of Java.</p>

        <p>Although not used in the example, <code>SourceTask</code> also provides two APIs to commit offsets in the source system: <code>commit</code> and <code>commitRecord</code>. The APIs are provided for source systems which have an acknowledgement mechanism for messages. Overriding these methods allows the source connector to acknowledge messages in the source system, either in bulk or individually, once they have been written to Kafka.
            The <code>commit</code> API stores the offsets in the source system, up to the offsets that have been returned by <code>poll</code>. The implementation of this API should block until the commit is complete. The <code>commitRecord</code> API saves the offset in the source system for each <code>SourceRecord</code> after it is written to Kafka. As Kafka Connect will record offsets automatically, <code>SourceTask</code>s are not required to implement them. In cases where a connector does need to acknowledge messages in the source system, only one of the APIs is typically required.</p>

        <h5><a id="connect_sinktasks" href="#connect_sinktasks">Sink Tasks</a></h5>

        <p>The previous section described how to implement a simple <code>SourceTask</code>. Unlike <code>SourceConnector</code> and <code>SinkConnector</code>, <code>SourceTask</code> and <code>SinkTask</code> have very different interfaces because <code>SourceTask</code> uses a pull interface and <code>SinkTask</code> uses a push interface. Both share the common lifecycle methods, but the <code>SinkTask</code> interface is quite different:</p>

        <pre class="brush: java;">public abstract class SinkTask implements Task {
    public void initialize(SinkTaskContext context) {
        this.context = context;
    }

    public abstract void put(Collection&lt;SinkRecord&gt; records);

    public void flush(Map&lt;TopicPartition, OffsetAndMetadata&gt; currentOffsets) {
    }</pre>

        <p>The <code>SinkTask</code> documentation contains full details, but this interface is nearly as simple as the <code>SourceTask</code>. The <code>put()</code> method should contain most of the implementation, accepting sets of <code>SinkRecords</code>, performing any required translation, and storing them in the destination system. This method does not need to ensure the data has been fully written to the destination system before returning. In fact, in many cases internal buffering will be useful so an entire batch of records can be sent at once, reducing the overhead of inserting events into the downstream data store. The <code>SinkRecords</code> contain essentially the same information as <code>SourceRecords</code>: Kafka topic, partition, offset, the event key and value, and optional headers.</p>

        <p>The <code>flush()</code> method is used during the offset commit process, which allows tasks to recover from failures and resume from a safe point such that no events will be missed. The method should push any outstanding data to the destination system and then block until the write has been acknowledged. The <code>offsets</code> parameter can often be ignored, but is useful in some cases where implementations want to store offset information in the destination store to provide exactly-once
            delivery. For example, an HDFS connector could do this and use atomic move operations to make sure the <code>flush()</code> operation atomically commits the data and offsets to a final location in HDFS.</p>

        <h5><a id="connect_errantrecordreporter" href="connect_errantrecordreporter">Errant Record Reporter</a></h5>

        <p>When <a href="#connect_errorreporting">error reporting</a> is enabled for a connector, the connector can use an <code>ErrantRecordReporter</code> to report problems with individual records sent to a sink connector. The following example shows how a connector's <code>SinkTask</code> subclass might obtain and use the <code>ErrantRecordReporter</code>, safely handling a null reporter when the DLQ is not enabled or when the connector is installed in an older Connect runtime that doesn't have this reporter feature:</p>

        <pre class="brush: java;">private ErrantRecordReporter reporter;

@Override
public void start(Map&lt;String, String&gt; props) {
    ...
    try {
        reporter = context.errantRecordReporter(); // may be null if DLQ not enabled
    } catch (NoSuchMethodException | NoClassDefFoundError e) {
        // Will occur in Connect runtimes earlier than 2.6
        reporter = null;
    }
}

@Override
public void put(Collection&lt;SinkRecord&gt; records) {
    for (SinkRecord record: records) {
        try {
            // attempt to process and send record to data sink
            process(record);
        } catch(Exception e) {
            if (reporter != null) {
                // Send errant record to error reporter
                reporter.report(record, e);
            } else {
                // There's no error reporter, so fail
                throw new ConnectException("Failed on record", e);
            }
        }
    }
}</pre>

        <h5><a id="connect_resuming" href="#connect_resuming">Resuming from Previous Offsets</a></h5>

        <p>The <code>SourceTask</code> implementation included a stream ID (the input filename) and offset (position in the file) with each record. The framework uses this to commit offsets periodically so that in the case of a failure, the task can recover and minimize the number of events that are reprocessed and possibly duplicated (or to resume from the most recent offset if Kafka Connect was stopped gracefully, e.g. in standalone mode or due to a job reconfiguration). This commit process is completely automated by the framework, but only the connector knows how to seek back to the right position in the input stream to resume from that location.</p>

        <p>To correctly resume upon startup, the task can use the <code>SourceContext</code> passed into its <code>initialize()</code> method to access the offset data. In <code>initialize()</code>, we would add a bit more code to read the offset (if it exists) and seek to that position:</p>

        <pre class="brush: java;">stream = new FileInputStream(filename);
Map&lt;String, Object&gt; offset = context.offsetStorageReader().offset(Collections.singletonMap(FILENAME_FIELD, filename));
if (offset != null) {
    Long lastRecordedOffset = (Long) offset.get("position");
    if (lastRecordedOffset != null)
        seekToOffset(stream, lastRecordedOffset);
}</pre>

        <p>Of course, you might need to read many keys for each of the input streams. The <code>OffsetStorageReader</code> interface also allows you to issue bulk reads to efficiently load all offsets, then apply them by seeking each input stream to the appropriate position.</p>

        <h5><a id="connect_exactlyoncesourceconnectors" href="#connect_exactlyoncesourceconnectors">Exactly-once source connectors</a></h5>

        <h6>Supporting exactly-once</h6>

        <p>With the passing of <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-618%3A+Exactly-Once+Support+for+Source+Connectors">KIP-618</a>, Kafka Connect supports exactly-once source connectors as of version 3.3.0. In order for a source connector to take advantage of this support, it must be able to provide meaningful source offsets for each record that it emits, and resume consumption from the external system at the exact position corresponding to any of those offsets without dropping or duplicating messages.</p>

        <h6>Defining transaction boundaries</h6>

        <p>By default, the Kafka Connect framework will create and commit a new Kafka transaction for each batch of records that a source task returns from its <code>poll</code> method. However, connectors can also define their own transaction boundaries, which can be enabled by users by setting the <code>transaction.boundary</code> property to <code>connector</code> in the config for the connector.</p>

        <p>If enabled, the connector's tasks will have access to a <code>TransactionContext</code> from their <code>SourceTaskContext</code>, which they can use to control when transactions are aborted and committed.</p>

        <p>For example, to commit a transaction at least every ten records:</p>

        <pre class="brush: java;">private int recordsSent;

@Override
public void start(Map&lt;String, String&gt; props) {
    this.recordsSent = 0;
}

@Override
public List&lt;SourceRecord&gt; poll() {
    List&lt;SourceRecord&gt; records = fetchRecords();
    boolean shouldCommit = false;
    for (SourceRecord record : records) {
        if (++this.recordsSent &gt;= 10) {
            shouldCommit = true;
        }
    }
    if (shouldCommit) {
        this.recordsSent = 0;
        this.context.transactionContext().commitTransaction();
    }
    return records;
}
</pre>

        <p>Or to commit a transaction for exactly every tenth record:</p>

        <pre class="brush: java;">private int recordsSent;

@Override
public void start(Map&lt;String, String&gt; props) {
    this.recordsSent = 0;
}

@Override
public List&lt;SourceRecord&gt; poll() {
    List&lt;SourceRecord&gt; records = fetchRecords();
    for (SourceRecord record : records) {
        if (++this.recordsSent % 10 == 0) {
            this.context.transactionContext().commitTransaction(record);
        }
    }
    return records;
}
</pre>

        <p>Most connectors do not need to define their own transaction boundaries. However, it may be useful if files or objects in the source system are broken up into multiple source records, but should be delivered atomically. Additionally, it may be useful if it is impossible to give each source record a unique source offset, if every record with a given offset is delivered within a single transaction.</p>

        <p>Note that if the user has not enabled connector-defined transaction boundaries in the connector configuration, the <code>TransactionContext</code> returned by <code>context.transactionContext()</code> will be <code>null</code>.</p>

        <h6>Validation APIs</h6>

        <p>A few additional preflight validation APIs can be implemented by source connector developers.</p>

        <p>Some users may require exactly-once semantics from a connector. In this case, they may set the <code>exactly.once.support</code> property to <code>required</code> in the configuration for the connector. When this happens, the Kafka Connect framework will ask the connector whether it can provide exactly-once semantics with the specified configuration. This is done by invoking the <code>exactlyOnceSupport</code> method on the connector.</p>

        <p>If a connector doesn't support exactly-once semantics, it should still implement this method to let users know for certain that it cannot provide exactly-once semantics:</p>

        <pre class="brush: java;">@Override
public ExactlyOnceSupport exactlyOnceSupport(Map&lt;String, String&gt; props) {
    // This connector cannot provide exactly-once semantics under any conditions
    return ExactlyOnceSupport.UNSUPPORTED;
}
</pre>

        <p>Otherwise, a connector should examine the configuration, and return <code>ExactlyOnceSupport.SUPPORTED</code> if it can provide exactly-once semantics:</p>

        <pre class="brush: java;">@Override
public ExactlyOnceSupport exactlyOnceSupport(Map&lt;String, String&gt; props) {
    // This connector can always provide exactly-once semantics
    return ExactlyOnceSupport.SUPPORTED;
}
</pre>

        <p>Additionally, if the user has configured the connector to define its own transaction boundaries, the Kafka Connect framework will ask the connector whether it can define its own transaction boundaries with the specified configuration, using the <code>canDefineTransactionBoundaries</code> method:</p>

        <pre class="brush: java;">@Override
public ConnectorTransactionBoundaries canDefineTransactionBoundaries(Map&lt;String, String&gt; props) {
    // This connector can always define its own transaction boundaries
    return ConnectorTransactionBoundaries.SUPPORTED;
}
</pre>

        <p>This method should only be implemented for connectors that can define their own transaction boundaries in some cases. If a connector is never able to define its own transaction boundaries, it does not need to implement this method.</p>

        <h4><a id="connect_dynamicio" href="#connect_dynamicio">Dynamic Input/Output Streams</a></h4>

        <p>Kafka Connect is intended to define bulk data copying jobs, such as copying an entire database rather than creating many jobs to copy each table individually. One consequence of this design is that the set of input or output streams for a connector can vary over time.</p>

        <p>Source connectors need to monitor the source system for changes, e.g. table additions/deletions in a database. When they pick up changes, they should notify the framework via the <code>ConnectorContext</code> object that reconfiguration is necessary. For example, in a <code>SourceConnector</code>:</p>

        <pre class="brush: java;">if (inputsChanged())
    this.context.requestTaskReconfiguration();</pre>

        <p>The framework will promptly request new configuration information and update the tasks, allowing them to gracefully commit their progress before reconfiguring them. Note that in the <code>SourceConnector</code> this monitoring is currently left up to the connector implementation. If an extra thread is required to perform this monitoring, the connector must allocate it itself.</p>

        <p>Ideally this code for monitoring changes would be isolated to the <code>Connector</code> and tasks would not need to worry about them. However, changes can also affect tasks, most commonly when one of their input streams is destroyed in the input system, e.g. if a table is dropped from a database. If the <code>Task</code> encounters the issue before the <code>Connector</code>, which will be common if the <code>Connector</code> needs to poll for changes, the <code>Task</code> will need to handle the subsequent error. Thankfully, this can usually be handled simply by catching and handling the appropriate exception.</p>

        <p><code>SinkConnectors</code> usually only have to handle the addition of streams, which may translate to new entries in their outputs (e.g., a new database table). The framework manages any changes to the Kafka input, such as when the set of input topics changes because of a regex subscription. <code>SinkTasks</code> should expect new input streams, which may require creating new resources in the downstream system, such as a new table in a database. The trickiest situation to handle in these cases may be conflicts between multiple <code>SinkTasks</code> seeing a new input stream for the first time and simultaneously trying to create the new resource. <code>SinkConnectors</code>, on the other hand, will generally require no special code for handling a dynamic set of streams.</p>

        <h4><a id="connect_configs" href="#connect_configs">Configuration Validation</a></h4>

        <p>Kafka Connect allows you to validate connector configurations before submitting a connector to be executed and can provide feedback about errors and recommended values. To take advantage of this, connector developers need to provide an implementation of <code>config()</code> to expose the configuration definition to the framework.</p>

        <p>The following code in <code>FileStreamSourceConnector</code> defines the configuration and exposes it to the framework.</p>

        <pre class="brush: java;">static final ConfigDef CONFIG_DEF = new ConfigDef()
    .define(FILE_CONFIG, Type.STRING, null, Importance.HIGH, "Source filename. If not specified, the standard input will be used")
    .define(TOPIC_CONFIG, Type.STRING, ConfigDef.NO_DEFAULT_VALUE, new ConfigDef.NonEmptyString(), Importance.HIGH, "The topic to publish data to")
    .define(TASK_BATCH_SIZE_CONFIG, Type.INT, DEFAULT_TASK_BATCH_SIZE, Importance.LOW,
        "The maximum number of records the source task can read from the file each time it is polled");

public ConfigDef config() {
    return CONFIG_DEF;
}</pre>

        <p><code>ConfigDef</code> class is used for specifying the set of expected configurations. For each configuration, you can specify the name, the type, the default value, the documentation, the group information, the order in the group, the width of the configuration value and the name suitable for display in the UI. Plus, you can provide special validation logic used for single configuration validation by overriding the <code>Validator</code> class. Moreover, as there may be dependencies between configurations, for example, the valid values and visibility of a configuration may change according to the values of other configurations. To handle this, <code>ConfigDef</code> allows you to specify the dependents of a configuration and to provide an implementation of <code>Recommender</code> to get valid values and set visibility of a configuration given the current configuration values.</p>

        <p>Also, the <code>validate()</code> method in <code>Connector</code> provides a default validation implementation which returns a list of allowed configurations together with configuration errors and recommended values for each configuration. However, it does not use the recommended values for configuration validation. You may provide an override of the default implementation for customized configuration validation, which may use the recommended values.</p>

        <h4><a id="connect_schemas" href="#connect_schemas">Working with Schemas</a></h4>

        <p>The FileStream connectors are good examples because they are simple, but they also have trivially structured data -- each line is just a string. Almost all practical connectors will need schemas with more complex data formats.</p>

        <p>To create more complex data, you'll need to work with the Kafka Connect <code>data</code> API. Most structured records will need to interact with two classes in addition to primitive types: <code>Schema</code> and <code>Struct</code>.</p>

        <p>The API documentation provides a complete reference, but here is a simple example creating a <code>Schema</code> and <code>Struct</code>:</p>

        <pre class="brush: java;">Schema schema = SchemaBuilder.struct().name(NAME)
    .field("name", Schema.STRING_SCHEMA)
    .field("age", Schema.INT_SCHEMA)
    .field("admin", SchemaBuilder.bool().defaultValue(false).build())
    .build();

Struct struct = new Struct(schema)
    .put("name", "Barbara Liskov")
    .put("age", 75);</pre>

        <p>If you are implementing a source connector, you'll need to decide when and how to create schemas. Where possible, you should avoid recomputing them as much as possible. For example, if your connector is guaranteed to have a fixed schema, create it statically and reuse a single instance.</p>

        <p>However, many connectors will have dynamic schemas. One simple example of this is a database connector. Considering even just a single table, the schema will not be predefined for the entire connector (as it varies from table to table). But it also may not be fixed for a single table over the lifetime of the connector since the user may execute an <code>ALTER TABLE</code> command. The connector must be able to detect these changes and react appropriately.</p>

        <p>Sink connectors are usually simpler because they are consuming data and therefore do not need to create schemas. However, they should take just as much care to validate that the schemas they receive have the expected format. When the schema does not match -- usually indicating the upstream producer is generating invalid data that cannot be correctly translated to the destination system -- sink connectors should throw an exception to indicate this error to the system.</p>

        <h3><a id="connect_administration" href="#connect_administration">8.4 Administration</a></h3>

        <p>
            Kafka Connect's <a href="#connect_rest">REST layer</a> provides a set of APIs to enable administration of the cluster. This includes APIs to view the configuration of connectors and the status of their tasks, as well as to alter their current behavior (e.g. changing configuration and restarting tasks).
        </p>

        <p>
            When a connector is first submitted to the cluster, a rebalance is triggered between the Connect workers in order to distribute the load that consists of the tasks of the new connector.
            This same rebalancing procedure is also used when connectors increase or decrease the number of tasks they require, when a connector's configuration is changed, or when a
            worker is added or removed from the group as part of an intentional upgrade of the Connect cluster or due to a failure.
        </p>

        <p>
            In versions prior to 2.3.0, the Connect workers would rebalance the full set of connectors and their tasks in the cluster as a simple way to make sure that each worker has approximately the same amount of work.
            This behavior can be still enabled by setting <code>connect.protocol=eager</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Starting with 2.3.0, Kafka Connect is using by default a protocol that performs
            <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-415%3A+Incremental+Cooperative+Rebalancing+in+Kafka+Connect">incremental cooperative rebalancing</a>
            that incrementally balances the connectors and tasks across the Connect workers, affecting only tasks that are new, to be removed, or need to move from one worker to another.
            Other tasks are not stopped and restarted during the rebalance, as they would have been with the old protocol.
        </p>

        <p>
            If a Connect worker leaves the group, intentionally or due to a failure, Connect waits for <code>scheduled.rebalance.max.delay.ms</code> before triggering a rebalance.
            This delay defaults to five minutes (<code>300000ms</code>) to tolerate failures or upgrades of workers without immediately redistributing the load of a departing worker.
            If this worker returns within the configured delay, it gets its previously assigned tasks in full.
            However, this means that the tasks will remain unassigned until the time specified by <code>scheduled.rebalance.max.delay.ms</code> elapses.
            If a worker does not return within that time limit, Connect will reassign those tasks among the remaining workers in the Connect cluster.
        </p>

        <p>
            The new Connect protocol is enabled when all the workers that form the Connect cluster are configured with <code>connect.protocol=compatible</code>, which is also the default value when this property is missing.
            Therefore, upgrading to the new Connect protocol happens automatically when all the workers upgrade to 2.3.0.
            A rolling upgrade of the Connect cluster will activate incremental cooperative rebalancing when the last worker joins on version 2.3.0.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can use the REST API to view the current status of a connector and its tasks, including the ID of the worker to which each was assigned. For example, the <code>GET /connectors/file-source/status</code> request shows the status of a connector named <code>file-source</code>:
        </p>

        <pre class="brush: json;">{
    "name": "file-source",
    "connector": {
        "state": "RUNNING",
        "worker_id": "192.168.1.208:8083"
    },
    "tasks": [
        {
        "id": 0,
        "state": "RUNNING",
        "worker_id": "192.168.1.209:8083"
        }
    ]
}</pre>

        <p>
            Connectors and their tasks publish status updates to a shared topic (configured with <code>status.storage.topic</code>) which all workers in the cluster monitor. Because the workers consume this topic asynchronously, there is typically a (short) delay before a state change is visible through the status API. The following states are possible for a connector or one of its tasks:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>UNASSIGNED:</b> The connector/task has not yet been assigned to a worker.</li>
            <li><b>RUNNING:</b> The connector/task is running.</li>
            <li><b>PAUSED:</b> The connector/task has been administratively paused.</li>
            <li><b>STOPPED:</b> The connector has been stopped. Note that this state is not applicable to tasks because the tasks for a stopped connector are shut down and won't be visible in the status API.</li>
            <li><b>FAILED:</b> The connector/task has failed (usually by raising an exception, which is reported in the status output).</li>
            <li><b>RESTARTING:</b> The connector/task is either actively restarting or is expected to restart soon</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            In most cases, connector and task states will match, though they may be different for short periods of time when changes are occurring or if tasks have failed. For example, when a connector is first started, there may be a noticeable delay before the connector and its tasks have all transitioned to the RUNNING state. States will also diverge when tasks fail since Connect does not automatically restart failed tasks. To restart a connector/task manually, you can use the restart APIs listed above. Note that if you try to restart a task while a rebalance is taking place, Connect will return a 409 (Conflict) status code. You can retry after the rebalance completes, but it might not be necessary since rebalances effectively restart all the connectors and tasks in the cluster.
        </p>

        <p>
            Starting with 2.5.0, Kafka Connect uses the <code>status.storage.topic</code> to also store information related to the topics that each connector is using. Connect Workers use these per-connector topic status updates to respond to requests to the REST endpoint <code>GET /connectors/{name}/topics</code> by returning the set of topic names that a connector is using. A request to the REST endpoint <code>PUT /connectors/{name}/topics/reset</code> resets the set of active topics for a connector and allows a new set to be populated, based on the connector's latest pattern of topic usage. Upon connector deletion, the set of the connector's active topics is also deleted. Topic tracking is enabled by default but can be disabled by setting <code>topic.tracking.enable=false</code>. If you want to disallow requests to reset the active topics of connectors during runtime, set the Worker property <code>topic.tracking.allow.reset=false</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
            It's sometimes useful to temporarily stop the message processing of a connector. For example, if the remote system is undergoing maintenance, it would be preferable for source connectors to stop polling it for new data instead of filling logs with exception spam. For this use case, Connect offers a pause/resume API. While a source connector is paused, Connect will stop polling it for additional records. While a sink connector is paused, Connect will stop pushing new messages to it. The pause state is persistent, so even if you restart the cluster, the connector will not begin message processing again until the task has been resumed. Note that there may be a delay before all of a connector's tasks have transitioned to the PAUSED state since it may take time for them to finish whatever processing they were in the middle of when being paused. Additionally, failed tasks will not transition to the PAUSED state until they have been restarted.

        <p>
            In 3.5.0, Connect introduced a stop API that completely shuts down the tasks for a connector and deallocates any resources claimed by them. This is different from pausing a connector where tasks are left idling and any resources claimed by them are left allocated (which allows the connector to begin processing data quickly once it is resumed). Stopping a connector is more efficient from a resource usage standpoint than pausing it, but can cause it to take longer to begin processing data once resumed. Note that the offsets for a connector can be only modified via the offsets management endpoints if it is in the stopped state.

    <h2><a id="streams" href="/documentation/streams">9. Kafka Streams</a></h2>
    <p>
        Kafka Streams is a client library for processing and analyzing data stored in Kafka. It builds upon important stream processing concepts such as properly distinguishing between event time and processing time, windowing support, exactly-once processing semantics and simple yet efficient management of application state.
    </p>
    <p>
        Kafka Streams has a <b>low barrier to entry</b>: You can quickly write and run a small-scale proof-of-concept on a single machine; and you only need to run additional instances of your application on multiple machines to scale up to high-volume production workloads. Kafka Streams transparently handles the load balancing of multiple instances of the same application by leveraging Kafka's parallelism model.
